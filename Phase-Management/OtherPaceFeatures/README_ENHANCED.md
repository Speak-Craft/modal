## 📈 Performance Monitoring

After running the pipeline, check:
- `validation_results.json` - Detailed performance metrics
- `validation_plots/` - Performance visualization plots
- `models/` - Trained model files

## 🎭 Synthetic Data Quality

The synthetic data generator creates realistic speech patterns by:
1. **Statistical Analysis**: Analyzing real data distributions
2. **Gaussian Mixture Models**: Modeling complex feature relationships
3. **Realistic Constraints**: Applying speech quality boundaries
4. **Quality Transitions**: Creating samples that represent improvement paths

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Low Accuracy
1. Increase synthetic data samples
2. Try different feature selection methods
3. Adjust model hyperparameters
4. Use ensemble methods

### Memory Issues
1. Reduce target_samples
2. Use fewer features
3. Process data in batches

### Dependencies Issues
```bash
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

## 📊 Model Performance

The system trains multiple models and selects the best performing one:

1. **Random Forest** - Good baseline performance
2. **XGBoost** - Often best for tabular data
3. **LightGBM** - Fast and efficient
4. **SVM** - Good for high-dimensional data
5. **Neural Networks** - Can capture complex patterns
6. **Ensemble** - Combines best models

## 🎯 Next Steps
