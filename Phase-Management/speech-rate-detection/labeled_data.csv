ielts-listening-0092-cam14-test-3-part-4.wav,"As you all know, the University is planning an arts festival for later this year, and here in the Music Department we've planned three concerts. These will be public performances, and the program has just been finalised. The theme of the festival is links between the UK and Australia, and this is reflected in the music. Each concert will feature both British and Australian composers. I'll tell you briefly about the Australian music, as you probably won't be familiar with that. The first concert will include music by Liza Lim, who was born in Perth, Western Australia in 1966. As a child, Lim originally learned to play the piano, like so many children, and also the violin. But when she was eleven, her teachers encouraged her to start composing. She found this was her real strength, and she studied and later taught composition, both in Australia and in other countries. As a composer, she has received commissions from numerous orchestras, other performers, and festivals in several countries. Liza Lim's compositions are vibrant and full of energy, and she often explores Asian and Australian Aboriginal cultural sources, including the native instrument, the Dijury Do. This is featured in a work called The Compass. Her music is very expressive, so although it is complex, it has the power of connecting with audiences and performers alike. In the festival, we're going to give a semi-staged performance of the Orestire. This is an opera in seven parts, based on the trilogy of Ancient Greek tragedies by Iskolas. Lim composed this when she was in her mid-twenties, and she also wrote the text along with Barry Kosky. It's performed by six singers, a dancer, and an orchestra that, as well as standard orchestral instruments, includes electric guitar and a traditional Turkish stringed instrument. Lim wrote that because the stories in the tragedies are not easy to tell. The sound she creates are also disturbing, and they include breathing, sobbing, laughing, and whistling. The work lasts around 75 minutes, and the rest of the concert will consist of orchestral works by the British composers, Rayf Vaughn Williams, and Frederick Delius. Moving on now to our second concert, this will begin with instrumental music by British composers, Benjamin Britain, and Judith Weir. After the interval, we'll go to Australia for a piece by Ross Edwards, the Tower of Remoteness. According to Edwards, the inspiration for this piece came from nature when he was sitting alone in the dry bed of a creek, overshadowed by the leaves of palm trees, listening to the birds and insects. The Tower of Remoteness is scored for piano and clarinet. Edwards says he realized years after writing the piece that he had subconsciously modeled its opening phrase on a bird call. Ross Edwards was born in 1943 in Sydney, Australia, and studied at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music and the Universities of Adelaide and Sydney. He's well known in Australia, and in fact he's one of the country's most performed composers. He's written a wide range of music from symphonies and concertos to some composed specifically for children. Edwards' music has been described as being deeply connected to Australia, and it can be regarded as a celebration of the diversity of cultures that Australia can be proud of. The last of the three Australian composers to be represented in our festival is Carl Vine. Born in 1954, Vine, like Liza Lim, comes from Perth, Western Australia. He took up the corner at the age of five, switching to the piano five years later. However, he went to university to study physics before changing to composition. After graduating, he moved to Sydney and worked as a freelance pianist and composer. Before long, he had become prominent in Australia as a composer for dance, and in fact has written 25 scores of that type. In our third concert, Vine will be represented by his music for the flag handover ceremony of the Olympics held in 1996. This seven-minute orchestral piece was of course heard by millions of people worldwide, and will hear it alongside works written by British composers Edward Elgar and more recently Thomas Ades.",352.438,117.80795487433252,Ideal
short-stories-0207-209-sport-canada.wav,"Sport Canada. Sport Canada is the name of Canada's federal government program to help support athletes. The purpose of Sport Canada is to develop and encourage Sport, Health and Exercise programs for all Canadians. However, Sport Canada's main emphasis is on high-performance athletes, training for major international athletic competitions, such as the Olympic Games. Sport Canada was created in the 1970s as a response to the perceived need to help athletes train and compete in international sport. Before the 1970s, athletes wishing to train and compete in sport had to support themselves financially. Athletes were either independently wealthy or were supported by family or friends. Unfortunately, many high-calibre athletes without such financial support simply could not afford to train and compete in international competition. Also, before the early 1970s, almost all international sports events were amateur. Amateur rules meant those receiving funds from government programs or corporations were breaking the rules of sport. Athletes receiving money were disqualified from competition. As a result, the amateur rules generally limited training and competition to those athletes who came from wealthier families. Less fortunate athletes, many of whom likely would have performed well for Canada in international competitions, simply could not afford to do so. Sport Canada has been a role model for many government-run sport programs around the world. With its central administrative offices in Canada's capital of Ottawa, Sport Canada efficiently provides administrative, coaching, and financial help for athletes across the country. Athletes can concentrate their efforts full-time on training and competition. As a result, Canada's share of the metal totals in the Olympic Games has risen since the 1970s. Recently, sport Canada's programs have been criticized by some who feel that the program does not provide enough money for athletes. While it does provide financial assistance to athletes, the amount paid is well below Canada's minimum wage. Critics point out that athletes work full-time and perform an important function for the Canadian government and people. As a result of this criticism, the Canadian government has provided more money for athletes. However, the amount is still below the minimum wage level. As a result, the amount paid to athletes is likely to rise in the future. As long as it effectively manages problems such as funding, Sport Canada will continue to provide the Canadian public with international caliber athletes who compete with the very best in the world.",154.7755625,153.90026445550794,Fast
short-stories-0264-267-etiquette.wav,"EDIKIT EDIKIT is a French word. The original meaning was little tickets. These tickets were given to people who were attending a public ceremony. Printed on the ticket were instructions about how to behave on this occasion. So etiquette came to mean the way to behave on public occasions. EDIKIT today includes how to introduce people, how to eat properly, how to dress for different occasions, how to speak to different people, and what to do on special occasions. But every part of social life can have its particular etiquette. Sometimes etiquette changes or seems to change. There was much behavior attached to courtships such as a man holding the door open for a woman. Nowadays, some people find this outdated. But politeness is always a good idea. It is nice to hold the door open for the next person, whoever they are. In fact, it sometimes seems like contemporary life encourages bad manners. It is no longer taught to young people. Moreover, in a youth culture, young people take their examples from other young people. As a result, good manners aren't considered important. The point of etiquette is to help people to get along with each other. If people behave in an accepted manner, there is less chance of misunderstanding. It is important for people to think about treating other people well. If everyone does what they feel like doing, it doesn't seem like they respect other people. People can help things to go a lot smoother. Manors vary from culture to culture, but the intention is the same, to treat people with consideration. This is a way to reduce conflict. Sometimes we can understand where these customs come from. Originally shaking hands with your right hand probably meant that you weren't carrying a weapon. Taking off your hat may originally have been taking off your helmet. This meant that you weren't going to fight. Nowadays there are new areas of social life. For example, a lot of conversation now takes place on the telephone. Perhaps because there is no traditional telephone etiquette, some people feel free to be rude. Try to treat the person on the phone just the way you would treat them if you were actually talking to them. Most people feel it is rude to interrupt a conversation, but many people seem to think that it is okay to interrupt someone talking on the phone. Children especially need to be taught not to interrupt. The internet also needs its own etiquette or netiquette, because you cannot see whom you are talking to, and they may be thousands of miles away, it is easy to misunderstand. Also people cannot hear the tone of your voice over the internet. For this reason some people use smiley's, little faces to show how they are feeling. If they make a joke, they can use a smiling face or print grin after their remark. This tips off the recipient that their remark is not to be taken seriously. Using simple words like please and thank you can make everyday life a lot smoother and happier. Like a lot of other things, we do not realize the importance of etiquette until it starts to disappear.",186.6188125,171.68687106504873,Fast
short-stories-0212-214-nike.wav,"Nike. Nike and its swish corporate symbol are among the most recognized brand names in the world alongside McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Disney. Starting in 1964 as a sports shoe outlet, the company grew to become the market leader in footwear and apparel. Nike has since diversified into a range of activities including sports event promotion. Owned by Phil Knight, Nike has become synonymous with world-class sport, especially through its sponsorship of events and elite athletes such as Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods. Nike has so ever-president in the sports consumer's minds that a survey conducted during the Atlanta Summer Olympic Games in 1996 revealed an extremely high awareness of Nike. Despite the fact that Nike was not an official sponsor of the games, Nike's success has to a great extent, and due to the fact of the company and its swish symbol, have become ubiquitous in consumers' minds. Nike has even run television commercials without even mentioning its own name, being confident enough that the checkmark swish is more than enough to make the company known. Phil Knight has been the main inspiration behind Nike in its corporate direction. A competent, although not elite, middle-distance runner at the University of Oregon, Knight went on to Harvard Business School where the Nike ID emerged out of a paper he developed for a class on entrepreneurship. Knight's former coach, Bill Bowerman, developed lightweight running shoes that became the new company's trademark in the early days. From these modest beginnings, Nike eventually grew to become the sports giant it is today. Ironically, part of Nike's status in the world of competitive sports merchandising has come from the attention it's received by critics. A short article published in the early 1990s in Harper's magazine quickly mushroomed into an international outcry against Nike's practice of placing their factories in underdeveloped countries and paying workers below subsistence wages. Nike quickly responded to the criticisms with a number of tactics to either divert attention away from the criticisms, ones that night, interestingly, at first in night, or by acknowledging the practices but claiming Nike was cleaning up its act. In many cases, Nike has made an effort to create better working conditions for those in underdeveloped countries making shoes and other merchandise. However, the overall effect of Nike's changes is not known and several groups around the world regularly check and often criticize Nike's labor practices. Nike's recent marketing extravaganza's include a $200 million US deal with a Brazilian national soccer federation. It has been rumored that Nike's ego has much to do with Nike's marketing strategies. Some critics have suggested that nights hidden agenda is no less than controlling sports marketing and merchandising throughout the world. Nike's corporate headquarters in Oregon reflect these aspirations. Nike's buildings and surrounding grounds are constructed very much like a religious cathedral only with elite athletes and night himself as the gods.",171.859625,167.92774917319875,Fast

She lived in a small town called Walton on the Thames in England, which is south of London. Her father Ted Wells was a teacher, and mother Barbara was a pianist and piano teacher. She also played piano for her sister's dancing school. Julie learned ballet and tap as a toddler from her aunt Joan Morris. But the time Julie was three, she could read and write. When Julie was four, her parents divorced, and Barbara married Ted Andrews, a performer during the war and an excellent tenor. He soon began giving Julie singing lessons. At seven years of age, Julie had an unbelievable range of four octaves. She soon changed her last name to Andrews, the last name of her stepfather. As she grew older, Julie became one of England's most popular performers. In early childhood, Julie loved to play with her two younger half-brothers, but soon went on to start them. At age 12, Julie was cast in a London play and stopped the show with her remarkable talent. She starred in many different BBC productions during the forties. Later she starred in many Broadway plays such as The Boyfriend, My Fair Lady, and Camelot. It was the latter play that Walt Disney made a special trip to New York to see, and he decided then and there that Julie was perfect for the role of Mary Poppins in the film of the same name. Mary Poppins was the high-spirited magical nanny of Jane and Michael Banks, two small British children. Julie also starred in many other films, such as The Americanization of Emily, Hawaii, Thoroughly Modern Millie, and my personal favorite, The Sound of Music. In this production, she plays Maria, the lively governess of Austrian naval captain George Von Trapp's seven children, Liesel, Frederick, Louisa, Kurt, Brigida, Marta, and Gretel. Another of Julie's talents is writing. Two of her best-known books are the last of the really great Wang Doodles and Mandy. Julie also has five children, a daughter, Emma Kate Walton from her marriage to Tony Walton, four children from her second marriage to Blake Edwards, two of whom were from Blake's previous marriage, Jennifer and Jeffrey, and two who were adopted from Vietnam, Amy and Joanna. In 1998, Tragedy struck Julie. She lost her extraordinary talent for singing due to surgery on her throat in order to remove a benign tumor. A year later, she made an attempt to sing again, however, her voice will never be the same.

When a town is very small, it is also called a village. My village was surrounded by many farms and many lakes. The house where my family lived was near the middle of the town. On the streets where we lived, most of the houses were similar in size, but many of them had different shapes and different colors. Each house was surrounded by a yard where people grew their lawn and their garden. Often I would walk from my house to the downtown part of the village. Downtown is the area where the stores and shops of a town are located. Because I lived in a small town, it was a short walk to the downtown area. Along the main street there are several different kinds of stores. Some stores sold food, some stores sold clothing, and some stores sold hardware or building supplies. It was also a short walk to the schools in my town. When I went to elementary school, it would take about 10 minutes to walk to the school. Some of my friends lived on the same street where I lived. Sometimes we walked to school together. During the summer months, many people came from the big city to visit our village. The people liked to get away from the busy streets of the city. They enjoyed the quietness and the slow pace of village life. They also liked to spend their vacations near the lakes that were near the village.

ielts-listening-0220-cam6-test-3-part-4.wav,"Good morning, everyone. Last week we were looking at the hunter-gatherers in Ireland across the Irish Sea from England. Today we're going to move on to the period between four and six thousand years ago, known as the Neolithic period, which is when a total farming economy was introduced in Ireland. Now, there are several hypotheses about the origins of the first Neolithic settlers in Ireland, but most of these contain problems. For instance, there are considerable archaeological difficulties about the theory that they came from England. The evidence doesn't really add up. But there are even greater practical problems about the theory that they came directly from continental Europe. For one thing, it's not clear just how sufficient numbers of men and women could have been transported to Ireland to establish a viable population. As you know, the hunter-gatherer economy which existed beforehand was based on small, scattered groups. The farming economy would almost certainly have required much larger communities to do all the work needed to plant and tend sufficient crops to sustain them through the year. The early farmers kept various animals, including cattle and sheep. There's also evidence of pigs, but it is possible that these could have been descended from the native wild species. Now we know from modern farming that if the level of breeding stock falls below about 300 females, the future of the species locally is at risk. So we must assume that from the beginnings of Neolithic farming, the number of breeding sheep would have considerably exceeded 300, and the National cattle herd must have been of a similar size. The question is, how these were brought to the area and where they came from? It's usually suggested that the Neolithic settlers used skin-covered boats to transport livestock, but this method would have severely restricted the range of the colonizing fleets. The sheer volume of animal transport necessary means it's unlikely that this livestock could have been brought from anywhere further than England. What about crops? Well, two main cereal crops were introduced to Ireland during this time, wheat and barley, both in several varieties. The main evidence for their presence consists of impressions on pottery, where a cereal grain accidentally became embedded in the surface of a pot before it was fired. The grain itself was destroyed by the firing, but it left an impression on the pot which could be studied and identified by botanists. Let's turn our attention now to the farming technology available at that time. Before the cereal crops could be planted, it would have been necessary to clear the forest and to break the ground by plowing. The stone blade of a plow has been discovered during excavation in County Mayo in Western Ireland. The body of the plow would have been a wood and could have been drawn by people, but it's also likely that cattle were used. Now, the cultivation of crops and the husbandry of livestock brought about changes in people's lifestyle, such as the type of shelters they made. For one thing, instead of moving from place to place, they needed permanent dwellings. The stone axes used to chop down trees to make these dwellings were far superior to any that the Stone Age hunter gatherers used. To make the axes, sources of suitable stone had to be found and systematically exploited. These so-called axe factories were really quarries rather than factories as the manufacture of the axes wasn't regularly performed on the quarry site. However, after the axe had been chipped into shape, they needed water and sand for grinding and polishing, so a high mountain side wouldn't have been an appropriate place for this. So this final stage of the manufacture must have been carried out close to water, and sure enough, there's ample evidence of this at coastal sites. Now, it's clear that these neolithic axes were transported all over Ireland, as well as to Scotland and the south of England. It's not really surprising that axes from axe factories in England have also been found in Ireland. At the very least, this indicates that there was a link between the two islands during that period. One of the most useful innovations of the colonizers was pottery making, which was quite unknown to Irish hunter gatherers. The pottery was probably made by shaping clay into a ball with the hand, and then hollowing it until the walls were the right thickness. After firing, the outside was often polished. This would have helped the pots to retain water as they weren't glazed. Now, we know that the clay used usually came from local sources, which suggests that manufacture was on a fairly small scale, even though thousands of fragments are usually found at neolithic sites. In the course of time, decoration began to appear. At first, this looked like a series of stitches and was just around the tops of the pots. This could have been an imitation of earlier vessels, which were made of leather, sewn onto wood. Then eventually, pots with decoration all over.",337.7701875,150.45732832771097,Fast

short-stories-0185-186-the-earth-revolves-around-the-sun.wav,"The earth revolves around the sun. One year is the time required for the earth to travel around the sun. For most of history, however, people did not know that the earth moved around the sun. Instead, people believed that the sun moved around the earth. The old idea that the sun moved around the earth is known as the geocentric theory. This idea was first made famous by an ancient Greek scientist, Ptolemy, who lived in Egypt nearly two thousand years ago. Some other Greek philosophers had suggested instead that the earth might travel around the sun. However, this idea, which is known as the heliocentric theory, was not widely accepted. For centuries, people in Europe did not seriously question Ptolemy's geocentric theory. In the early 15th century, however, a Polish astronomer named Nicholas Copernicus began to think that the heliocentric idea was right and that the geocentric idea was wrong. Shortly before his death, Copernicus wrote a book that described the mathematical details of his theory that the earth revolved or traveled around the sun. Later, astronomers came to agree with Copernicus' view. One of the most famous of these was Galileo, an Italian scientist. Galileo is famous for demonstrating that light and heavy objects fall at exactly the same speed unless an object is so light that it is slowed by the air. Galileo was also the first astronomer to use a powerful telescope to observe the sky. He discovered many unknown features of the moon, the sun, and the planets. When Galileo announced that he believed in Copernicus' theory that the earth revolved around the sun, some officials of the Roman Catholic Church were angry. They argued that this theory was against the beliefs of the church. Some church officials disagreed with his view, but the authorities decided that Galileo should be punished by house arrest. In other words, Galileo was not allowed to leave his house. So Galileo was forced to make a public statement that renounced his belief in the heliocentric theory. At about the same time that Galileo supported the heliocentric idea, another astronomer did some important work that supported Copernicus' view. This astronomer was Johannes Kepler, who lived in Germany. Kepler used the observations of previous scientists to figure out the motion of the planets around the sun. He realized that the planets did not travel in circular paths, but instead in paths that were elliptical or oval in shape. Kepler's discoveries showed mathematically how the planets would revolve around the sun. Today everyone knows that the earth moves around the sun, but for a long time it seemed more reasonable to believe that the sun moved around the earth. We can thank the great scientists of the past who discovered the surprising truth.",192.391875,144.08092857351696,Ideal

ielts-listening-0024-cam18-test-2-part-4.wav,"Good morning. Now, we've been asked to choose an aspect of European clothing or fashion and to talk about its development over time. I decided to focus on a rather small area of clothing and that's pockets. I chose pockets for two reasons, really. We all have them in jeans, jackets, coats, for example. And even though we often carry bags or briefcases as well, nothing is quite as convenient as being able to pop your phone or credit card into your pocket. Yet, I suspect that other than that, people don't really think about pockets too much and they're rather overlooked as a fashion item. It's certainly very interesting to go back in time and see how pockets developed for men and women. In the 18th century, fashion's were quite different from the way they are now and pockets were too. If we think about male fashion first, that was the time when suits became popular. Traurs were knee length only and referred to as breaches. The waistcoats were short and the jackets were long. But all three garments were lined with material and pockets were sewn into this cloth by whichever tailor the customer used. The wearer could then carry small objects such as pencils or coins on their person and reach them through a gap in the lining. Code pockets became increasingly decorative on the outside for men who wanted to look stylish. But they were often larger but plainer if the wearer was someone with a profession who needed to carry medical instruments, a doctor or physician, for example. The development of women's pockets was a little different. For one thing, they weren't nearly as visible or as easy to reach as men's. In the 18th and 19th centuries, women carried numerous possessions on their person and some of these could be worth a lot of money. Women were more vulnerable to theft and wealthy women in particular worried constantly about pick pockets. So what they did was to have a pair of pockets made that were tied together with string. The pockets were made of fabric which might be recycled cloth if the wearer had little money or something more expensive such as linen, sometimes featuring very delicate embroidery. Women tied the pockets around their waist so that they hung beneath their clothes. Remember, skirts were long then and there was plenty of room to hide a whole range of small possessions between the layers of petticoats that were commonly worn. They would have an opening in the folds of their skirts through which they could reach whatever they needed, like their perfume. Working women of course also needed to carry around items that they might use for whatever job or trade they were involved in, but their pairs of pockets still remained on the inside of their clothing. They just got bigger or longer, sometimes reaching down to their knees. So the tie-on pockets went well into the 19th century and only changed when fashion ordered towards the end of that period. That's when dresses became tighter and less bulky and the pairs of pockets became very noticeable. They stood out too much and detracted from the woman's image. Women who had been used to carrying around a range of personal possessions and still wanted to needed somewhere to carry these items about their person. That was when small bags or pouches, as they were known, came into fashion and of course they inevitably led onto the handbag of more modern times, particularly when fashion removed pockets altogether.",266.027375,133.97117495896802,Ideal
ielts-listening-0144-cam11-test-4-part-4.wav,"As we saw in the last lecture, a major cause of climate change is the rapid rise in the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere over the last century. If we could reduce the amount of CO2, perhaps the rate of climate change could also be slowed down. One potential method involves enhancing the role of the soil that plants grow in, with regard to absorbing CO2. Rat and Laugh, a soil scientist from Ohio State University in the USA, claims that the world's agricultural soils could potentially absorb 13% of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the equivalent of the amount released in the last 30 years, and research is going on into how this might be achieved. Laugh first came to the idea that soil might be valuable in this way, not through an interest in climate change, but rather out of concern for the land itself and the people dependent on it. Carbon rich soil is dark, crumbly and fertile, and retains some water, but erosion can occur if soil is dry, which is a likely effect if it contains inadequate amounts of carbon. Erosion is of course bad for people trying to grow crops or breed animals on that terrain. In the 1970s and 80s Laugh was studying soils in Africa so devoid of organic matter that the ground had become extremely hard, like cement. There he met a pioneer in the study of global warming, who suggested that carbon from the soil had moved into the atmosphere. This is now looking increasingly likely. Let me explain. For millions of years, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have been regulated, in part, by a natural partnership between plants and microbes, tiny organisms in the soil. Plants absorb CO2 from the air and transform it into sugars and other carbon-based substances. While a proportion of these carbon products remain in the plant, some transfer from the roots to fungi and soil microbes, which store the carbon in the soil. The invention of agriculture some 10,000 years ago disrupted these ancient soil-building processes and led to the loss of carbon from the soil. When humans started draining the natural top soil and plowing it up for planting, they exposed the buried carbon to oxygen. This created carbon dioxide and released it into the air, and in some places, grazing by domesticated animals, has removed all vegetation, releasing carbon into the air. Tons of carbon have been stripped from the world's soils where it's needed and pumped into the atmosphere. So, what can be done? Researchers are now coming up with evidence that even modest changes to farming can significantly help to reduce the amount of carbon in the atmosphere. Some growers have already started using an approach known as regenerative agriculture. This aims to boost the fertility of soil and keep it moist to establish practices. These include keeping fields planted all year round and increasing the variety of plants being grown. Strategies like these can significantly increase the amount of carbon stored in the soil, so agricultural researchers are now building a case for their use in combating climate change. One American investigation into the potential for storing CO2 on agricultural lands is taking place in California. Soil scientist Wendy Silver of the University of California, Berkeley, is conducting a first of its kind study on a large cattle farm in the state. She and her students are testing the effects on carbon storage of the compost that is created from waste, both agricultural, including manure and cornstorks, and waste produced in gardens such as leaves, branches and lawn trimmings. In Australia, soil ecologist Christine Jones is testing another promising soil enrichment strategy. Jones and 12 farmers are working to build up soil carbon by cultivating grasses that stay green all year round. Like composting, the approach has already been proved experimentally. Jones now hopes to show that it can be applied on working farms and that the resulting carbon capture can be accurately measured. It's hoped in the future that projects such as these will demonstrate the role that farmers and other land managers can play in reducing the harmful effects of greenhouse gases. For example, in countries like the United States, where most farming operations use large applications of fertilizer, changing such long standing habits will require a change of system. Ratan Lau argues that farmers should receive payment, not just for the corn or beef they produce, but also for the carbon they can store in their soil.

ielts-listening-0192-cam8-test-4-part-4.wav,"Good morning everyone. I've been invited to talk about my research project into Australian Aboriginal rock paintings. The Australian Aborigines have recorded both real and symbolic images of their time on rock walls for many thousands of years. Throughout the long history of this tradition, new images have appeared and new painting styles have developed. And these characteristics can be used to categorise the different artistic styles. Among these are what we call the dynamic, yam and modern styles of painting. One of the most significant characteristics of the different styles is the way that humans are depicted in the paintings. The more recent paintings show people in static poses. But the first human images to dominate rock art paintings over 8,000 years ago were full of movement. These paintings showed people hunting and cooking food and so they were given the name dynamic to reflect this energy. It's quite amazing considering they were painted in such a simple stick-like form. In the yam period, there was a movement away from stick figures to a more naturalistic shape. However, it didn't go as far as the modern style, which is known as X-ray, because it actually makes a feature of the internal skeleton as well as the organs of animals and humans. The yam style of painting got its name from the fact that it featured much curvia figures that actually resemble the vegetable called the yam, which is similar to a sweet potato. The modern paintings are interesting because they include paintings at the time of the first contact with European settlers. Aborigines managed to convey the idea of the settlers clothing by simply painting the Europeans without any hands, indicating the habit of standing with their hands in their pockets. Size is another characteristic. The more recent images tend to be life-size or even larger, but the dynamic figures are painted in miniature. Aboriginal rock art also records the environmental changes that occurred over thousands of years. For example, when know from the dynamic paintings that over 8,000 years ago, Aborigines would have rarely eaten fish and sea levels were much lower at this time. In fact, fish didn't start to appear in paintings until the yam period, along with shells and other marine images. The paintings of the yam tradition also suggest that during this time, the Aborigines moved away from animals as their main food source and began including vegetables in their diet as these feature prominently. Fresh water creatures didn't appear in the paintings until the modern period from 4,000 years ago. So these paintings have already taught us a lot. But one image that has always intrigued us is known as the Rainbow Serpent. The Rainbow Serpent, which is the focus of my most recent project, gets its name from its snake or serpent-like body and it first appeared in the yam period 4 to 6,000 years ago. Many believe it is a curious mixture of kangaroo, snake and crocodile. But we decided to study the Rainbow Serpent paintings to see if we could locate the animal that the very first painters based their image on. The yam period coincided with the end of the last ice age. This brought about tremendous change in the environment with the sea levels rising and creeping steadily inland. This flooded many familiar land features and also caused a great deal of disruption to traditional patterns of life, hunting in particular. New shores were formed and totally different creatures would have washed up onto the shores. We studied 107 paintings of the Rainbow Serpent and found that the one creature that matches it most closely was the Ribbon pipefish, which is a type of sea horse. This sea creature would have been a totally unfamiliar site in the inland regions where the image is found and may have been the inspiration behind the early paintings. So, at the end of the ice age there would have been enormous changes in animal and plant life. It's not surprising then that the Aborigines linked this abundance to the new creatures they witnessed. Even today, Aborigines see the Rainbow Serpent as a symbol of creation, which is understandable given the increase in vegetation and the new life forms that featured when the image first appeared.",278.2245,153.97637519341396,Fast

short-stories-0171-172-chinese-people-in-north-america.wav,"Chinese people in North America. In recent years, many people have moved to North America from China, but many people do not know that Chinese people have a long history in Canada and the United States. During the 19th century, both Canada and the United States were rapidly expanding to the west toward the Pacific Ocean. In those days, there were of course no cars or airplanes to allow people and goods to move across the land. Instead, the best method of long distance transportation was the railroad. Railway trains could move quickly across the countryside. However, there was one problem. Before the railway trains could run, railroads had to be built across very long distances. To build the railroads roads was a very big job. Many men would be needed because a distance was so long and the land was so difficult, with many mountains and rivers to be crossed. For the men who owned the railroad companies, it would have been too expensive to hire Canadian or American men to build the railroads, because those workers would only work for high wages. The railroad owners decided to get workers from overseas. Many Chinese men were willing to work for low wages because they were very poor. These men would work very hard and send much of the money back to their relatives in China. Thousands of Chinese men were brought to North America to work on the railroads. They did good work, but their employers treated them badly. The work day was very long and working conditions were very unsafe. Many Chinese men died in accidents while constructing the railroads. Some Chinese women also came to North America, but there were many more men than women. After the railroads were completed by about the year 1900, very few Chinese people were allowed to come to North America. Most people in Canada and the United States were not familiar with Chinese people and did not want strangers to come to their countries. Any Chinese person who came to North America had to pay an expense of tax. This made it difficult for Chinese men to bring their wives and families to join them in North America. Later the governments of Canada and the United States made Chinese immigration illegal. Eventually the people of Canada and the United States realized that their laws had been unfair. They changed the rules so that Chinese people could immigrate in the same way the people from other countries could do so. In recent decades many Chinese people have moved to North America and have formed a very lively and successful community. Many cities such as Toronto, Vancouver, San Francisco and New York have been enriched by Chinese culture. Chinese people are now very prominent in North America, just as they were many years ago.",192.026125,147.1674752589003,Ideal
ielts-listening-0082-cam14-test-1-part-2.wav,"Good morning everyone. My name is Janet Parker and I'm the Human Resources Manager. We're very happy to welcome you to your new apprenticeship. I hope that the next six months will be a positive and enjoyable experience for you. I'd like to start with some general advice about being an apprentice. Most of you have very little or no experience of working for a big organisation and the first week or so may be quite challenging. There will be a lot of new information to take in, but don't worry too much about trying to remember everything. The important thing is to check with someone if you're not sure what to do. You'll find your supervisor is very approachable and won't mind explaining things or helping you out. You're here to learn, so make the most of that opportunity. You'll be spending time in different departments during your first week, so make an effort to talk to as many people as possible about their work. You'll make some new friends and find out lots of useful information. As well as having a supervisor, you'll each be assigned a mentor. This person will be someone who's recently completed an apprenticeship and you'll meet with them on a weekly basis. Their role is to provide help and support throughout your apprenticeship. Of course, this doesn't mean they'll actually do any of your work for you. Instead, they'll be asking you about what goals you've achieved so far as well as helping you to identify any areas for improvement. You can also discuss your more long-term ambitions with them as well. Now, I just want to run through a few company policies for our apprenticeship scheme with you. Most importantly, the internet. As part of your job, you'll be doing some research online, so obviously you'll have unlimited access for that. But please don't use it for personal use. You'll have your own phones for that. Some of you have already asked me about flexible working. After your probationary three-month period, some of you will be eligible for this. But it will depend on which department you're in and what your personal circumstances are. So please don't assume you'll automatically be permitted to do this. I want to make sure there's no confusion about our holiday policy. Apart from any statutory public holidays, we ask that you don't book any holidays until after your six-month apprenticeship has finished. Time off should only be taken if you are unwell. Please speak to your supervisor if this is going to be a problem. You'll be expected to work a 40-hour week, but there may be opportunities to do overtime during busy periods. Although you're not required to do this, it can be a valuable experience. So we advise you to take it up if possible. Obviously, we understand that people do have commitments outside work, so don't worry if there are times when you are unavailable. As you know, we don't have a formal dress code here. You may wear casual clothes as long as they are practical. And the only restriction for shoes we have is on high heels for health and safety reasons. Comfortable shoes like trainers are preferable. There's a heavily subsidised canteen on-site where you can get hot meals or salads cheaply. Snacks and drinks are also provided, so we've decided to introduce a no-packed lunch policy. This is partly to encourage healthy eating at work and partly to stop people from eating at their work station, which is unhygienic. Okay, moving on to...",262.6865,135.67503468963955,Ideal
short-stories-0259-262-conquering-lake-ontario.wav,"Conquering Lake Ontario In 490 BC, the Greek runner-filippities ran the 24 miles from Marathon to Athens to announce the Athenian victory. His endurance was so much admired that runners ever since have attempted to run similar long marathon distances. In the 20th century however, long-distance swimming has also attracted attention and admiration. To swim the English Channel or Wanda Fuca Strait between Vancouver Island and the mainland have become challenges for both male and female swimmers. In September 1954, some Canadian businessmen from Toronto offered veteran Californian champion Florence Chadwick $10,000 if she could swim Lake Ontario. They felt sure that such a feat would attract large crowds. Chadwick had swam the English Channel in both directions. However, no one, neither man nor woman had crossed Lake Ontario. It was a 32-mile swim through cold water and difficult currents. Two other women also decided to take up the challenge. One, Winnie Roach-Lousler had also swam the English Channel. The other was a 16-year-old girl named Marilyn Bell. The swimmers traveled to the mouth of the Niagara River on the south side of Lake Ontario. They would swim from Youngstown in the USA back to Toronto. Bad weather delayed the swim for several days. During the night of September 8, the weather cleared, and the swimmers entered the water before midnight. Guided by her coach's flashlight, Marilyn swam through the dark water and soon passed Chadwick, who was lifted from the water after swimming 12 miles. Lousler made it further, but she too eventually had to give up. Marilyn not only had to overcome her fears of the dark, but she was attacked during the night by blood-sucking lamprey eels. She was able to knock these off with her fist. As Dawn approached, the winds and waves increased, and Marilyn's weariness mounted. Her coach, Gus Ryder, passed her some corn syrup on a stick, and later gave her liniment for her tired legs. He wrote messages on a blackboard to encourage her to keep going. Sometimes he tricked her into thinking that she was nearer to the shore than she was. Marilyn fell asleep in the water twice and had to be awakened. The second time, a friend of hers jumped into the water beside her, and swam with her for a distance. Because Marilyn's strength was declining, she was being pushed off course by the currents. Although the direct route was 32 miles, Marilyn swam a total of 45 miles. The last few miles were extremely difficult. Marilyn's family and the lifeguards felt that she should be taken out of the water. But her coach threatened to quit as her coach if the swimmer gave up. It was getting dark again, and the swimmer was barely conscious as she approached the shore. Thousands of people lined the shore hoping to touch her, or get a picture of her. Marilyn's supporters had to push the crowds back so they wouldn't stop her from touching the shore. Finally, after 21 hours in the water, Marilyn reached land. The exhausted girl was rushed to an ambulance. She had lost about 20 pounds of her 120 pounds weight in the crossing. Finally, she was able to sleep. Huge crowds came out to see her the next day, and two days later, there was a parade in her honor through the streets of Toronto. Everyone admired the courage and endurance of the 16-year-old girl, who became the first person to swim across Lake Ontario.",205.348625,169.4678987989328,Fast

ielts-listening-0018-cam18-test-1-part-2.wav,"Good evening everyone. Let me start by welcoming you all to this talk and thanking you for taking the time to consider joining ACE voluntary organisation. ACE offers support to people and services in the local area and we're now looking for more volunteers to help us do this. By the way, I hope you're all comfortable. We have brought in extra seats so that no one has to stand but it does mean that the people at the back of the room may be a bit squashed. We'll only be here for about half an hour, so hopefully that's okay. One of the first questions we're often asked is how old you need to be to volunteer. Well, you can be as young as 16 or you can be 60 or over. It all depends on what type of voluntary work you want to do. Other considerations such as reliability are crucial in voluntary work and age isn't related to these in our experience. Another question we get asked relates to training. Well, there's plenty of that and it's all face to face. What's more, training doesn't end when you start working for us. It takes place before, during and after periods of work. Often it's run by other experienced volunteers as managers tend to prefer to get on with other things. Now, I would ask you to consider a couple of important issues before you decide to apply for voluntary work. We don't worry about why you want to be a volunteer. People have many different reasons that range from getting work experience to just doing something they've always wanted to do. But it is critical that you have enough hours in the day for whatever role we agree is suitable for you. If being a volunteer becomes stressful, then it's best not to do it at all. You may think that your income is important, but we don't ask about that. It's up to you to decide if you can work without earning money. What we value is dedication. Some of our most loyal volunteers earn very little themselves, but still give their full energy to the work they do with us. Okay, so let's take a look at some of the work areas that we need volunteers for and the sort of things that would help you in those. You may wish simply to help us raise money. If you have the creativity to come up with an imaginative or novel way of fundraising, we'd be delighted as standing in the local streets or shops with a collection box can be rather boring. One outdoor activity that we need volunteers for is litter collection. And for this, it's useful if you can walk for long periods, sometimes uphill. Some of our regular collectors are quite elderly, but very active and keen to protect the environment. If you enjoy working with children, we have three vacancies for what are called playmates. These volunteers help children learn about staying healthy through a range of out of school activities. You don't need to have children yourself, but it's good if you know something about nutrition and can give clear instructions. If that doesn't appeal to you, maybe you would be interested in helping out at our Story Club for disabled children, especially if you have done some acting. We put on three performances a year based on books they have read, and we're always looking for support with the theatrical side of this. The last area I'll mention today is First Aid. Volunteers who join this group can end up teaching others in vulnerable groups who may be at risk of injury. Initially, though, your priority will be to take in a lot of information and not forget any important steps or details. Right, so does anyone have any questions for me about...",261.782125,147.60366086874726,Ideal

ielts-listening-0282-ielts-recent-actual-test-3-part-2.wav,"Hello everyone and welcome to the Fit for Life Health Center. A place which, as the name suggests, is not just for short-term solutions, but rather intends to put you on a sensible and achievable footing for the rest of your life. And that's how we're different. For example, we could immediately put you on a harsh exercise program, expecting you to work out every day, but such a plan would see you quickly lose interest. That's why the initial step is a one and a half hour consultation in which your lifestyle, current situation, and long-term goals are all thoroughly analysed. Now, an important part of this consultation involves analysing what you eat. There's no point exercising here and losing weight, and putting it all back on later. You will need to show self-control and discipline in your diet, and we'll work on that. Similarly, we'll put you on an exercise regime suitable for your level of fitness. So that will involve a test where we will take you through some activities. Then measure your heart rate and blood pressure to determine how fit you are. This will be monitored during every subsequent consultation, along with your exercise schedule, and that occurs monthly and not half yearly, as with many other centres. As to our actual exercise machines and programmes, you will have to decide whether it is muscle mass, stamina, or general fitness that you want to develop. Think about which of these three you want to target, and we'll design a specific programme for you. But remember, bulging muscles aren't necessarily suitable for everyone. Sometimes it's better to think in terms of two simple concepts, muscle definition and stamina, or if you are female, being fit and healthy, in both mind and body. Now, if you're going to work out at this gym, you'll need to think about your reasons for exercising. So let's consider that in more detail. Muscle mass is certainly popular with the guys, probably seeking to impress the girls, and with muscles comes the confidence to do that, right? Well, for that, you'll need our high stress weight units, where pumping iron is all the rage. Moving on to other benefits, one of the main ones is beating the tension of life, right? And the longer the exercise is, the greater the rewards in this respect. Thus, playing squash can certainly help, and so can swimming. But what's much better, as every jogger will tell you, is their activity. So we have ample jogging machines, and they're always popular. They can provide good fitness too, as can the yoga classes. However, again, let's not forget playing squash, which I would say is the optimum way to improve your general well-being. Such an active, energetic game, plus the competitive element, drives you forward into high levels of health and fitness. These, of course, are the ultimate purposes of being here, but remember, the centre is full of like-minded people, all of whom are interesting to meet, and valuable sources of information. The yoga classes have a pre- and post-meeting session, so you'll certainly meet others there, although they'll all be yoga enthusiasts, which limits the range somewhat. But whether doing yoga, swimming, or exercising, everyone showers, right? So those facilities are where you'll hear all sorts of interesting conversations, and really get to know people. Not like the front desk area, which is mostly empty as patrons go immediately inside to do their exercise. Of course, the front desk can answer all your questions, and has information brochures and such like, but for knowing more about a greater variety of subjects and community concerns, look at the notice board in the yoga studio, where there's a huge array of papers, leaflets, and articles, all for you to read and consider.",253.6738125,150.42940232547653,Fast

ielts-listening-0292-ielts-recent-actual-test-5-part-4.wav,"If you consider the farms of old, the type your father or grandfather grew up on, they were small and labor intensive, requiring lots of workers. In addition, they often had a diversity of products, be that animal or vegetable, say cows and sheep, or oranges and lemons, with some peaches and a few chickens on the side for the production of eggs. The many workers involved raised their families who needed products and support services, such as medical clinics and schools, so the small country towns had mercantile activity, storefronts and community participation with all ages present and a distinct town culture and how it has changed. Travel to any small country town in virtually any developed country, and you will often see that these places are now somewhat full-on and deserted, lacking life and vigor. Many of the residents have long since moved towards the big cities, so the country areas have become depopulated and their downtown's empty. This phenomenon is so predictable and widespread that it even has a name, rural flight or rural Exodus, and it has produced some fairly predictable problems. As for the causes of rural Exodus, the most obvious is the industrialization of agriculture. This comes in two aspects, one of them being monocultural farming practices. What this means is that it is now more efficient to have one product and focus on its needs almost exclusively. So for example, animal husbandry will usually involve a single type of animal, say pigs, but with huge factory farming techniques or, in other words, the second aspect. Economies of scale. This means instead of 200 pigs, there will be 2000, tightly fitted into small pens or cages with high density waste disposal and automatic feeding systems. Yet, despite this huge size, it can all be controlled by just a dozen farm workers pushing the right button. You might not like it, but in a competitive market, the cheaper the overheads, the better, and one can't argue with market economics. It's simply the way of the modern world, and it has changed the face of rural districts mostly for the worst. We can talk at length about the problem of rural exodus, but what about solutions? Well, there is certainly some cause for hope, since many are now feeling the negatives of increasing urbanization, negatives which the countryside generally does not have. Thus, tourism, for example, is certainly one avenue of revenue and revitalization. The most important consideration here is that the local residents themselves participate in developing such initiatives and deciding what happens, since outsiders, be they state government or city-based planners, do not fully understand the local settings, the possibilities which may be on offer, or the town culture, since even small rural areas can be highly distinctive from neighbouring ones. For example, the Dalesford area has developed a tourist industry based on the natural springs there, putting forward the angle that this water is relaxing and revitalising for the health. There has been the development of spars, saunas, and small-scale accommodation within its picturesque hillsides, and another solution is to utilise the predominant local product. This takes advantage of the fact that many city people are developing a dislike for factory produced and packaged foodstuffs. They are becoming interested in products that can be sold directly to them at a cheaper price, while preserving all the freshness from the tree or animal. It is important here that the country area is not only characterised by a specific product, but markets this idea well. For example, many areas of country Victoria have developed widespread grape growing and wine making facilities and encourage wine tasting tourism, now a thriving industry with an international patronage. Similarly, Harcourt is famous for apples, shepherds and mature cheeses and milgeura for its citrus products. Such strategies, done well, give hope that rural areas can revitalise someone, and once again be lively and interesting places to live in.",302.0666875,130.69961579262196,Ideal

short-stories-0252-255-the-stratford-festival.wav,"The Stratford Festival The Shakespearean Festival in Stratford, Ontario is one of the greatest theatrical festivals in the world. This is the story of how this small town, which is far from any theatrical centers, became so important for drama. For most of its history, Stratford was the county town for the local farming region. It was also a railway center, but it was hardly known for the arts. An Irishman who opened an inn there found it Stratford in 1832. He called his roadhouse Shakespearean in after England's great dramatist. Soon, the little town became known as Stratford after the town in England where Shakespeare was born. The local river was likewise called the Avon after the English River. The little town grew gradually and became the local center for government and law. Stratford people seemed to enjoy the association with Shakespeare. Many streets were given Shakespearean names such as Arden Park, Portia Boulevard, Romeo Streets and Viola Court. Local schools received names such as Hamlet Public School or Fall Staff School. There was still no attempt at Shakespearean theatre in Stratford, Ontario. In 1913, the Canadian Pacific Railway threatened to take over the town. They proposed a railway line running through the centre of Stratford, which would have taken over much of the town's parkland. The townspeople voted down this proposal. Instead, they expanded the parkland along the Avon River. These parks were enhanced with gardens and in 1918 a pair of swans was added. These swans were an imitation of the swans on English rivers. In 1950, it appeared that the railway would be closing some of its workshops in Stratford. The town was looking for ideas that might lead to new employment opportunities. This was when one citizen, Tom Patterson, suggested that the town sponsor Adroma Festival. Patterson was able to get Irish director Tyrone Guthrie to come to Stratford in 1952. Guthrie agreed to head up the 1953 season. Everyone in Stratford pitched in to raise the necessary money and prepared the stage. Since there was no time to put up a building, the plays were staged under a huge tent. Two plays were put on during a six week season and with great success. In 1957, a permanent theatre was built. The Stratford season in 2001 runs for more than six months from late April to early November. There are 14 plays in production at three different theatres. Altogether, there are 668 performances with a total attendance of 580,000 people. About 40% of the audience comes from the United States. Tom Patterson's plan to ease on employment in Stratford has worked well. The festival has helped to create nearly 6,000 jobs and generate wages and salaries of $110 million annually. In total, the festival brings about $170 million of revenue into the Stratford area. Of course, to the audiences who come back every year, the main attraction is seeing some of the best Shakespearean theatre in the world. The Stratford Festival Company is Canada's leading acting company and many of its actors have become internationally known.",209.4236875,146.6882775617252,Ideal

ielts-listening-0276-ielts-recent-actual-test-1-part-4.wav,"Most of us are familiar with a local park. We spend time there, play there and have some of our best memories in these places. But what is a park? Basically, it can be defined as a natural, or at least semi-natural, piece of land, planted with a variety of trees, bushes and flowers, protected and reserved for the enjoyment of all citizens. There are usually regulations about the sorts of behaviour that can take place within, and sometimes there are facilities such as children's playgrounds or fields for ball games and other sorts of activities. For this reason, if there is grass, it is kept short, and this also discourages the breeding of insect pests. A well-maintained park actually needs a lot of people to look after it, and more so if the park showcases special plants, flowers or trees, in which case it is called a botanic garden. In complete contrast, if the park is big and remote enough, it is sometimes designated as a wilderness park, to be left completely alone and untouched, protected from all development in order to allow wild species, both plant and animal, to live undisturbed. But it is the urban park, the sort of park that most people are familiar with that I want to talk about now. These preserve natural landscapes for the pleasure of the urban population, most commonly just for passive recreation. In other words, allowing people just to observe the trees and lie in the grass, and such passive recreation is certainly needed. Continuing on the subject of parks, it might surprise you to know that once there were none. A thousand years ago, there was no need since there were already extensive open spaces, forests and wilderness surrounding most cities and towns, for example, in Europe. These dark dank forests were large and even dangerous, full of wild animals and with a potentially fatal result of getting lost. Hence, fairy tales evolved about witches living in these areas and the wolves and bears which could threaten young children. However, with the rapidly increasing human population, the original wilderness and natural open spaces were intruded upon. Forests were cut down as population spread and with them urban pollution and further deforestation. But it was only with the advent of the industrial revolution that people realized natural areas needed to be preserved, to give the populace access to the sort of nature that was fast disappearing due to the uncontrolled development and demand for resources. The first park, expressly designed for that purpose, is usually considered to be Prince's Park in Liverpool. This was in 1841, on land donated to the public by a rich iron merchant. With such a generous donation, worth about 50,000 pounds, the council decided to invest 5,000 pounds of its own money in making it look good. Consequently, they hired a landscape designer Joseph Paxton, who designed twisting turning pathways among shade giving trees, all based around a central lake. In many ways, it became the prototype for all later large parks, including the famous Central Park in New York. But, if we were to pick the park that most people are familiar with, it would be the much smaller neighborhood park. These can be tiny, but by being in the midst of extensive development and dense populations, they are increasingly seen as a refuge, where one can get a glimpse of true nature. Many psychologists now maintain that this glimpse is necessary, for ultimately, as a species, we have an innate affinity for nature and the concrete urban zoo clashes without inner being. This has seen a rejuvenation of many urban parks that were once left to decay, for example, in New York or London, and indeed some cities such as Melbourne, unknown all over the world for their abundance of carefully maintained parks, including a world-famous Botanic Garden.",261.279125,148.34709814647456,Ideal
ielts-listening-0256-cam4-test-4-part-4.wav,"Today we're going to look at one of my favourite fish, the shark. As you know, sharks have a reputation for being very dangerous creatures, capable of injuring or killing humans. And I'd like to talk about sharks in Australia. Sharks are rather large fish, often growing to over 10 meters. And the longest sharks caught in Australia have reached 16 meters. Sharks vary in weight with size and breed, of course. But the heaviest shark caught in Australia was a white pointer. That weighed 795 kilograms, quite a size. Sharks have a different structure to most fish. Instead of a skeleton made of bone, they have a tough elastic skeleton of cartilage. At bone, this firm pliable material is rather like your nose and allows the shark to bend easily as it swims. The shark's skin isn't covered with scales like other fish. Instead, the skin's covered with barbs giving it a rough texture like sandpaper. As you know, sharks are very quick swimmers. This is made possible by their fins, one set at the side and another set underneath the body. And the tail also helps the shark move forward quickly. Unlike other fish, sharks have to keep swimming if they want to stay at a particular depth and they rarely swim at the surface. Mostly they swim at the bottom of the ocean, scavenging and picking up food that's lying on the ocean floor. While most other animals, including fish, hunt their prey by means of their eyesight, sharks hunt essentially by smell. They have a very acute sense of smell and can sense the presence of food long before they can see it. In Australia, where people spend a lot of time at the beach, the government has realized that it must prevent sharks from swimming near its beaches. As a result, they've introduced a beach netting program. Beach netting or meshing involves setting large nets parallel to the shore. This means that the nets on New South Wales beaches are set on one day and then lifted and taken out to sea on the next day. When shark netting first began in 1939, only the Sydney metropolitan beaches were meshed. These beaches were chosen because beaches near the city are usually the most crowded with swimmers. Ten years later, in 1949, systematic meshing was extended to include the beaches to the south of Sydney. As a result of the general success of the program in Sydney, shark meshing was introduced to the state of Queensland around 1970. The New Zealand authorities also looked at it, but considered meshing uneconomical as did Tahiti in the Pacific. At around the same time, South Africa introduced meshing to some of its most popular swimming beaches. When meshing began, approximately 1,500 sharks were caught in the first year. However, this declined in the years that followed, and since that time, the average annual catch has been only about 150 a year. The majority of sharks are caught during the warmest months from November to February, when sharks are most active, and when both the air and the ocean are at their maximum temperature. Despite quite large catches, some people believe that shark meshing is not the best way to catch sharks. It's not that they think sharks are afraid of nets, or because they eat holes in them, because neither of these is true, but meshing does appear to be less effective than some other methods, especially when there are big seas with high rolling waves and strong currents, and anything that lets the sand move. The sand that's holding the nets down, when this moves, the nets will also become less",244.185375,150.62327135685337,Fast

ielts-listening-0122-cam12-test-3-part-2.wav,"In this session in your training day, we're going to look at some of the more specialized holidays we offer at BC Travel. Now, the travel business is very competitive and it's important to be aware of how the markets changing and developing. In terms of age groups, the over 65s are an important market and one that's increasing steadily year on year. The fewest holidays are taken by the 31 to 42-year-olds and that figure shows no sign of rising. The biggest market at present is still the youngest group, the 16 to 30s, but this group's also seen the biggest drop over the last few years, whereas there's a noticeable growth in the number of holidays taken by the 55 to 64-year-olds. As far as the 43 to 54-year-olds are concerned, bookings there are steady, but I have to say we haven't seen the increase we expected. One trend we're noticing with nearly all age groups is the growing popularity of holidays in which clients do some kind of specialized activity. I'm not talking here about adventure holidays where clients take part in high-risk activities like white water rafting just for the thrill of it. Activity holidays usually involve rather less high-risk sports or things like art and music. They're not necessarily cheaper than ordinary holidays, often the opposite in fact, but they do often take place outside the main tourist centers, which gives an opportunity to be able to get a better place for the rest of the day. The opportunity for clients to find out more about the local people and customs, and many say this is one of the most positive features of these holidays. Of course, they offer the chance to develop a new skill or talent, but clients often say that more than this, it's the chance to create lasting relationships with other like-minded people. That's the main draw. Let me give you some examples of BC travel activity holidays. Our painting holidays take place in four different centers in France and Italy, and they're very popular with clients of all abilities from beginners onwards. We've got an excellent team of artists to lead the classes. Some of them have been with us from the start, and five additional ones will be joining us this year so that we can offer a greater number of classes. We've got a lot of different classes in each center. As far as cooking holidays are concerned, I know a lot of agents offer holidays where clients cook recipes related to one particular country, usually the one they're staying in, but we focus on dishes from a great many different ones. We've got a lot of different cultural and cultural events that are usually on good quality organic ingredients that's more or less a given nowadays, and there are generally some meat-free recipes included. Our photography holidays take place in a wide range of countries from Iceland to Vietnam, and clients have the opportunity to see some stunning scenery. Groups are small, no more than eight, so clients can have one-on-one tuition during the holiday, and excursions are arranged with fully trained guides. At the end of each holiday, an exhibition is held of the photographs taken so that clients can see one another's work and receive valuable feedback from the tutor. Finally, let me tell you about our fitness holidays. In Ireland and Italy, we run one week general fitness classes for all ages and levels of fitness. Clients start the course with a consultation with a trainer, and together they draw up an individual program. As well as improving general fitness, clients find that they end up losing much of the stress they've built up in their daily lives. In Greece, we have a two-week holiday for clients who want to do something about their weight. This has all the features you'd expect like a personalized diet program, but one of its most popular features is that the exercise classes are all held on the beach. People say it's far preferable to being in a gym. Finally, we offer several holidays in Morocco. One very popular one is the Mountain Biking Holiday. Bikes are provided, and there are different routes according to people's ability. We offer one which is tailored to the needs of families, which is particularly popular.

short-stories-0228-230-paul-kane-frontier-artist.wav,"Paul Cain, Frontier Artist. Since Christopher Columbus first met American Indians in 1492, many Europeans had been fascinated by Indian life and culture. As a result, there was a demand in Europe for drawings and paintings of Native Americans. European artists who had never seen an Indian supplied most of this demand. But in the 19th century, several painters traveled into Indian territory to make an authentic record of Native life. One of the first artists to do this was the American painter George Catlin. In 1841, Catlin published a book of his work. Catlin's work helped inspire another important Frontier artist, the Canadian Paul Cain. Paul Cain was born in Ireland in 1810. His family moved to Toronto, Ontario, Canada when Paul was nine years old. The young boy was not very interested in school. At that time, there were still Indians living in wigwams in the Toronto area. Young Paul liked visiting the Indian village instead of going to school. Since Paul spent little time in school, he was largely a self-taught artist. He also became a surprisingly good writer, considering that he had not spent much time studying spelling or grammar. After working some years making and decorating furniture, Cain was ready to travel. He spent the years from 1836 to 1841, living and traveling in the United States. Then he traveled in Europe from 1841 to 1843, studying the great painters of the past. He was back in the USA until 1845, and then he returned to Toronto. Immediately upon his return, Cain headed into the wilderness areas around Georgian Bay, Susaint Murray, and Lake Michigan. His plan was to sketch Indian life before it disappeared forever. American Indians were dying so rapidly from European diseases, such as measles and smallpox, that many people believed they would soon vanish as a race. Their culture was threatened too. As white settlers demanded more land, Indians were being heard into small pieces of land called reservations. Here they could no longer practice their traditional way of life. Cain wanted to capture Native American life, while it still existed. Cain returned to Toronto at the end of 1845. He had received one good piece of advice, and that was if he wanted to travel into the wilderness, he would have to go with experienced people. He was able to get the support of the governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, Sir George Simpson. In May 1846, Cain joined the annual canoe fleet of fur traders going west. Cain would travel all through the wilderness areas of western Canada and north-western USA. During this time, he made hundreds of sketches of Indian life. Although Cain faced incredible hardships during his travels, he was able to see what he wanted to see. He was able to take part in one of the last great buffalo hunts and killed two large bison himself. Traveling west with the fur traders, he visited many forts and trading posts. He saw and painted a prairie fire. He shot a grizzly bear at close range and killed several wolves that attacked his horses. He learned to travel long distances on snow shoes in winter. Finally, he arrived at the Pacific coast where he made some fine drawings of the west coast Indians. European diseases had reached there just before Cain. 1500 Indians had died near Fort Vancouver in the summer of 1848. One wealthy chief had ruled 1,000 warriors and had ten wives, four children and eighteen slaves. Now, he had only one wife, one child and two slaves. Cain had not come too soon. However, there were tribes still unaffected by western culture and western diseases. Cain also traveled widely around the Columbia River in northwestern USA. Everywhere he went, he sketched Indian chiefs and scenes of native life. On his return trip, he encountered a large war party of 1500 braves on the warpath against their traditional enemies. He was able to sketch the leading chief, Big Snake, who was later killed in single combat during the battle. When he arrived back in Toronto, Cain gave an exhibit of his sketches and watercolors. Most of the rest of his life was spent turning these drawings into finished paintings.",275.25225,153.45923602804336,Fast

short-stories-0210-212-the-olympic-games.wav,"The Olympic Games The modern Olympic Games began in the late 19th century as a revival of the ancient Greek Olympics. Now just over 100 years old, the modern Olympic movement is the biggest and most important sports movement in the world. In fact, many people believe the Olympic Games to be the most important cultural event of any kind in the world. The modern Olympic Games were the brainchild of Frenchman, Baron Pierre de Couparté. D'Couparté's dream for an international sports event and cultural movement became a reality in 1894 at the International Athletic Congress in Paris. After the games were constituted in 1894, the first Olympic Games was held in Athens, Greece in 1896 in recognition of the ancient Greek Olympic Games. The original purpose of the Olympic Games in D'Couparté's mind was to celebrate and strengthen the physical, mental and cultural qualities of humanity. The games would blend sport with culture, tradition and education. The philosophy of Olympism is based on the joy of physical and mental effort and the respect for universal ethical principles. D'Couparté envisioned creating a more noble and sympathetic humanity through the Olympic movement. The sports events themselves D'Couparté modelled after the English public school sports system. He saw an upper-class English boy sport, the qualities of camaraderie, nobility and honesty. Most importantly, however, was adherence to the rules of sport in particular the rule that stated sport ought to be amateur in nature. D'Couparté believed participants should never participate in sport for the purpose of making money to do so would contradict the underlying philosophy of sport. Breaking the amateur rule in D'Couparté's time was as serious a violation as taking drugs to enhance performances in today's world of sport. Over time, the Olympic's grew to be the largest international festival of any kind. Today, debates exist as to the degree to which the modern games adhere to D'Couparté's original intent. On the one hand, Olympic sport is truly international in nature as D'Couparté would have wanted it. On the other hand, it is doubtful that D'Couparté would have admired the existence of politics, commercialism and drug use in sport. The Olympics have become truly international, but perhaps at a price. There is little question that the Olympic Games hold out the possibility for fulfilling D'Couparté's original goal of sport contributing to a better, more peaceful and understanding world.",156.2645,152.43385413833596,Fast

short-stories-0230-252-pocahontas-and-john-smith.wav,"Pocahontas and John Smith. In 1606, King James of England approved the establishment of two colonies along the eastern coast of America. The Northern colony in Maine lasted only a year. The southern one at Jamestown in Virginia became England's first permanent settlement in America. In 1607, the Virginia Company sent 104 settlers to Virginia. The settlers lived in Tans all summer, by September more than 60 were dead because they lacked good food or water. The leaders of the colony were not energetic and did little to make the settlers find food. One member of the company, Captain John Smith, was determined that the colony would survive. Smith pressured the colonists to build huts, a storehouse, and a church. He made daring trips to Indian villages, demanding that they give the settlers food in return for beads and copper. He threatened settlers who were trying to leave the colony and go back to England. On one of his trips to the interior, Indians attacked John Smith. They killed his two companions, but captured him alive. He was taken first to the local chief. This chief was impressed by Smith's compass and spared his life. His captors dragged Smith from village to village. He finally arrived at the town belonging to Poquaton. Poquaton was a great chief for all of the tribes in that region. Poquaton and his advisors talked about what to do with Smith. Suddenly Smith was dragged forward and his head was pushed against a stone. The warriors raised their clubs to kill Smith. Then Pocahontas, who was Poquaton's 12-year-old daughter, begged for his life. Her words had no effect, so Pocahontas ran to Smith. She took his hand in her arms and laid her own head against his head. Smith was released and went back to James Town. Soon after Smith returned, one hundred new settlers from England arrived. It was a very cold winter, and in January, James Town was accidentally set on fire. The settlers suffered from cold and hunger the rest of the winter. Every four or five days, Pocahontas and her attendants came. They brought food for the hungry settlers. Even so, half of them died. In the summer, John Smith explored that part of the coast of America. He made a map that would be very valuable for future sailors and settlers. On his return, Smith was elected leader of the colony at James Town. However, some settlers did not like having to follow rules. Some encouraged the Indians to try to kill Smith. Chief Pocahontan agreed. He also refused to supply food to the colony, hoping to starve them out. Pocahontas warned Smith about the plot against his life. Smith had to fight off several attempts to kill him. Finally, the colony seemed to be growing, and the Indians became peaceful. But in late 1609, Smith was injured in an explosion and returned to England. Pocahontas remained a friend to the colony. She married John Rolf, one of the settlers. In 1616, she traveled to England with her husband and son. There she saw John Smith once again. She was so surprised to see him that she was unable to speak for several days. Pocahontas had believed that Smith was dead. The following year, she died and was buried in England. Pocahontas' love for Smith and Smith's determination to fight for the colony had saved Jamestown and given the English their first colony in America.",212.2971875,162.50804076243355,Fast

ielts-listening-0184-cam8-test-2-part-4.wav,"I've been doing some research into what people in Britain think of doctors, the ones who work in general practice, the first call for medical care, and comparing this with the situation in a couple of other countries. I want to talk about the rationale behind what I decided to do. Now I had to set up my program of research in three different countries, so I approached post-graduates in my field in overseas departments, contacting them by email, to organize things for me at their end. I thought I would have trouble recruiting help, but in fact everyone was very willing, and sometimes their tutors got involved too. I had to give my helpers clear instructions about what kind of sample population I wanted them to use. I decided that people under 18 should be excluded because most of them are students or looking for their first job. And also I decided at this stage just to focus on men who were in employment and set up something for people who didn't have jobs and for employed women later on as a separate investigation. I specifically wanted to do a questionnaire and interviews with a focus group. With the questionnaire rather than limiting it to one specific point, I wanted to include as much variety as possible. I know questionnaires are a very controlled way to do things, but I thought I could do taped interviews later on to counteract the effects of this. And the focus group may also prove useful in future by targeting subjects I can easily return to as the participants tend to be more involved. So I'm just collating the results now. At the moment it looks as if in the UK, despite the fact that newspapers continually report that people are unhappy with medical care, in fact it is mainly the third level of care, which takes place in hospitals that they are worried about. But the report reforms have been proposed at all levels, and although their success is not guaranteed, long-term hospital care is in fact probably less of an issue than the media would have us believe. However, I've still got quite a bit of data to look at. Certainly I will need to do more far-reaching research than I had anticipated in order to establish if people want extra medical staff invested in the community, or if they want care to revert to fewer but larger key medical units. The solution may well be something that can be easily implemented by those responsible in local government, with central government support of course. This first stage has proved very valuable though. I was surprised by how willing most of the subjects were to get involved in the project. I had expected some unwillingness to answer questions honestly, but I was taken aback and rather concerned that something I thought I'd set up very well didn't necessarily seem that way to everyone in my own department. I thought you might also be interested in some of the problems I encountered in collecting my data. There were odd cases that threw me. One of the subjects who I had approached while he was out shopping in town decided to pull out when it came to the second round. It was a shame, as it was someone who I would like to have interviewed more closely. And one of the first-year students I interviewed wanted reassurance that no names would be traceable from the answers. I was so surprised because they think nothing of telling you about themselves and their opinions in seminar groups. Then one of the people that I worked with got a bit funny. The questions were quite personal, and one minute he said he'd do it. Then the next day he wouldn't. And in the end he did do it. It's hard not to get angry in that situation, but I tried to keep focused on the overall picture in order to stay calm. The most bizarre case was a telephone interview I did with a teacher at a university in France. He answered all my questions in great detail. But then when I asked how much access he had to dangerous substances, he wouldn't tell me exactly what his work involved. It was a real eye opener.",290.216875,148.64745545895633,Ideal
short-stories-0224-226-ireland.wav,"Ireland Ireland is an island in the Atlantic Ocean, just west of Britain. For much of its history, it has been an advantage to Ireland to be far from the mainland. The Romans or the other early empires never conquered Ireland. It was the remoteness of Ireland that helped preserve much of Christian and classical culture. After the fall of the Roman Empire, wandering tribes destroyed much of what remained on the continent. Finally, it was Ireland's turn to be invaded. First, the Norsemen or Vikings attacked during the 800s and 900s. Then, in the 1100s, the English invaded Ireland. Since that time, there has always been an English presence in Ireland. The conflict between the English and the Irish grew worse in the 1500s. Then the English became Protestant, and the Irish remained Catholic. In the 1600s, Oliver Cromwell tried to make Ireland Protestant by driving out the Catholics and bringing in Protestant settlers. In the centuries following, Irish Catholics had very few rights in their own country. The Catholic Irish were not allowed to vote until 1829. Since Irish Catholics were not allowed to own land, they were poor tenet farmers. They paid rent to the English landlords. The main food crop in the 1840s was potatoes. When these became infected by blight, thousands of Irishmen starved. Many others were evicted from their dwellings because they couldn't pay the rent. Hundreds of thousands of Irish took ship for North America. The Catholic Irish preferred to go to the United States because Canada was under British influence. However, many Protestant Irish went to Canada. The influence of the Irish on North American culture has been very great in many areas. And Irish Americans include President John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan. Meanwhile, in Ireland itself, a strong independence movement developed. A rebellion against England in 1916 began a struggle that resulted in independence for most of Ireland. Some Protestant areas in Northern Ireland preferred to stay with England. Republican groups such as the Irish Republican Army wanted to liberate the North from British rule. In the early days, conflict between Protestants and Catholics is limited to these Northern counties. Constant attempts are being made to bring the conflict there to an end. Meanwhile, the Irish Republic of Er has become prosperous again. It can sell its agricultural products to the European common market. Irish beer and whiskey are sold all over the world. Ireland is also becoming known for its high-tech industries. Because of this relative prosperity, the population is increasing again after a century and a half of decline. The Irish differ from other people because the vast majority of Irishmen live away from their homeland. However, this exodus from Ireland has helped to spread Irish music, culture, and products around the world. On St. Patrick's Day, March 17th, nearly everyone becomes Irish for the day.

For years, the idea of intelligent life on other planets has been very popular. Many books and movies tell stories of what those forms of life might be like. Many scientists believe that very simple forms of life are likely to exist on many other planets. Under the right conditions, simple life forms might arise. Those conditions, which include moisture and warmth, might occur in many parts of the universe. Fewer scientists believe that very intelligent forms of life are likely to exist on many other planets. For intelligent life to evolve, a very long period of time is needed. During that time, the conditions on a planet must not be too harsh. Otherwise, the evolving life forms will die. The amount of water, heat, and various chemicals must be just right. If not, then complex life might never evolve. The conditions needed for intelligent life to evolve are very unlikely to occur on any one planet. However, some scientists believe that intelligent life might be common in the universe. Because there are so many stars and planets in the universe, there might be a few places that have intelligent life. However, those places are probably very, very far away. Other scientists disagree.

short-stories-0232-234-gribbio.wav,"Gribio St. Francis of Assisi, who lived in Italy in the early 13th century, was known for his love of animals. He was the first person who celebrated the birth of Jesus by gathering live animals around a manger. He often talked to the birds as he traveled along. Sometimes the birds would fly down and sit on his head, shoulders, knees, and arms. But the best known animal story concerns St. Francis and the wolf of Gribio. St. Francis was known for his humility and his unwillingness to hurt anyone. Once, when one of his followers spoke harshly to some bandits, St. Francis told the man to run after the bandits and apologize. In the same way, St. Francis thought of animals as his brothers and sisters. Once when he was warned about some dangerous wolves, he replied that he had never harmed brother wolf and didn't expect the wolf to harm him. While St. Francis was staying in the hill town of Gribio, he heard about a large fierce wolf. The townspeople were terrified of this wolf and had eaten both domestic animals and humans. St. Francis decided to help the people and went out to talk to the wolf. The people watched in horror as the wolf came running to attack St. Francis. But the saint made the sign of the cross. Then he said to the wolf that, in the name of Jesus, it should stop hurting people. The wolf then lay down at St. Francis's feet. St. Francis addressed a little sermon to the wolf. He recounted all the terrible things that the wolf had done, but he added that he wanted to make peace between the wolf and the townspeople. The wolf nodded head in approval. In return for the wolf's agreement to keep the peace, St. Francis promised him that he would arrange for the townspeople to feed him. When he asked the wolf never again to harm any person or animal, the wolf nodded again. Then the wolf put out its paw as a sign that it would keep its promise. The wolf walked beside St. Francis back into Gribio. When a crowd assembled, the saint preached to them about how God had allowed the wolf to terrify them because of their sins. He told them to repent, and God would forgive them. Then he spoke of the promise that the wolf had made and what he had promised the wolf in return. The people agreed to feed the wolf regularly, and the wolf again indicated that it would not hurt anyone. Again, it put its paw in St. Francis's hand. The wolf and the people kept the agreement. Two years later, the wolf died. The people remembered how it no longer hurt anyone and that not a single dog ever barked at it. The townspeople of Gribio lamented its death.

ielts-listening-0300-ielts-recent-actual-test-7-part-4.wav,"Hello class and welcome back to marketing strategies. This week I will expand upon last week's lecture by talking about factors you should consider when creating advertising materials and the effects they can have on your product sales. Lesson 1. Limit your advertising to the geographic area of your target market. Though you may have a product that people want in a large area, the distance that customers are willing to travel is a significant factor in their choice of where to purchase that product. Take this example. If you're really hungry and decide you want a barito, would you choose the restaurant that is a block from your apartment or the one that is just as good or even slightly better across town? Of course you'd pick the closer restaurant. Next there's the method of communication to your target market. How do you decide among radio ads, TV commercials, flyers or even word of mouth? Why we often think of the visual presentation of ads there's much more to advertising than the look. Studies show that consumers are much more likely to remember advertising slogans if there's also a sound plate. Did you know that your sense of smell is closely linked with memory? Think about Mandy's candy store up the road. Every time you walk past it, you can just smell the chocolate. Right? I bet you can almost smell it now. Just mentioning the name brings about the smell memory and in turn a chocolate craving. What better way to sell chocolate bars? Obviously, sometimes appealing to the senses isn't the most practical way to advertise. For example, it's a good idea to come up with a marketing strategy that adapts to the product, especially digital products. The flexibility of this kind of products is extremely important. So it's very common for advertisers to form one single layout for all of their ads, the visual, the medium, even the majority of the content, and simply update the ad each time they come out with a new version. Remember, advertising is all about stirring up the right feeling in your potential customers, whether by stimulating the senses, appealing to the intellect and so on. Once the customer experiences the ad, the important thing is his or her reaction. Someone could love the ad you made, but unless he or she considers buying the product, you fail to get the reaction you were looking for. So once you have successfully reached your target customer and you have his or her business, often you'll want to expand to a larger market, more often than not. The same marketing strategies you used in your small campaign may not work for a larger audience. The larger you scale your product, the more factors you must consider. For instance, Apple operates worldwide, so they must tailor their advertising for each market they enter. Often you'll see Apple ads on international flights that appear not only in English, which is the lingua franca of most regions, but also in the native languages of the majority of passengers. I traveled to Russia last week, and it was really interesting to see the same Nike ad that I've seen 100 times, except this time it was in Russian. Okay, going back to the medium of the advertisement, even after choosing to create print ads instead of radio announcements, television commercials, etc. There is more to consider. If you print your ad in a newspaper, it will be read by a far different audience than if you print your ad in a popular magazine. Would you put an ad for the new Justin Bible album in a newspaper? Probably not, because that product is most suitable for youths. Let's face it, do you know anyone under the age of 25 that buys a newspaper? No. Now let's try a few strategy exercises. Imagine you're a company that is aiming to improve the environment by making products that reduce human waste. How would you advertise your product? Clearly it would send the wrong message if you put up flyers or other materials that cause lots of waste paper. Consider instead putting commercials on the health channel or buying ad space on websites like UNESCO. Or here's another example. What is one great place to advertise suntan lotion? How about a swimming pool? It has the exact group of people that need the product. Alright, one last thing. Let's say you're filming a commercial for a water filter picture. What would be good scenery to use for the background? Think about somewhere calm and relaxing with clean fresh water. Can't you see how much more effective a commercial with the beautiful scenery and flowing rivers of a national park would be than say water dripping from a tap? So to wrap things up today, think about the geography of your target market, the type of marketing material you should use, and the most effective way to appeal to the customer in order to make a successful ad campaign. That is all I have for you today. Make sure to read through chapter 8 for Monday if you have not done so already. Okay, now I'd be happy to answer any questions you may have.",353.203,148.6397340905938,Ideal

ielts-listening-0052-cam16-test-1-part-4.wav,"Ancient philosophy is not just about talking or lecturing or even reading long dense books. In fact, it is something people have used throughout history to solve their problems and to achieve their greatest triumphs. Specifically, I am referring to stoicism, which in my opinion is the most practical of all philosophies and therefore the most appealing. Stoicism was founded in Ancient Greece by Xenno of Sittium in the early 3rd century BC but was practiced by the likes of Epictetus, Kato, Seneca and Marcus Aurelius. Amazingly, we still have access to these ideas, despite the fact that the most famous Stoics never wrote anything down for publication. Kato definitely didn't. Marcus Aurelius never intended his meditations to be anything but personal. Seneca's letters were letters and Epictetus's thoughts come to us by way of a note-taking students. Stoic principles were based on the idea that its followers could have an unshakable happiness in this life and the key to achieving this was virtue. The road to virtue in turn lay in understanding that destructive emotions like anger and jealousy are under our conscious control. They don't have to control us because we can learn to control them. In the words of Epictetus, external events I cannot control but the choices I make with regard to them I do control. The modern day philosopher and writer Nassim Nicholas Taylebb defines a Stoic as someone who has a different perspective on experiences which most of us would see as wholly negative. A Stoic transforms fear into caution, pain into transformation, mistakes into initiation and desire into undertaking. Using this definition as a model we can see that throughout the centuries Stoicism has been practiced in more recent history by kings, presidents, artists, writers and entrepreneurs. The founding fathers of the United States were inspired by the philosophy. George Washington was introduced to Stoicism by his neighbors at age 17 and later put on a play based on the life of Cato to inspire his men. Thomas Jefferson kept a copy of Seneca beside his bed. The authors and artists have also been inspired by the Stoics. Eugene Delacroix, the renowned French romantic artist known best for his painting Liberty Leading the People, was an ardent Stoic referring to it as his consoling religion. The economist Adam Smith's theories on capitalism were significantly influenced by the Stoicism that he studied as a schoolboy under a teacher who had translated Marcus Aurelius's works. Today's political leaders are no different, with many finding their inspiration from the ancient texts. Former US President Bill Clinton re-reads Marcus Aurelius every single year, and many have compared former President Obama's calm leadership style to that of Cato. When Jiao Bao, the former Prime Minister of China, claims that meditations is one of two books he travels with, and that he has read it more than 100 times over the course of his life. Stoicism had a profound influence on Albert Ellis, who invented cognitive behavior therapy, which is used to help people manage their problems by changing the way that they think and behave. It's most commonly used to treat depression. The idea is that we can take control of our lives by challenging the irrational beliefs that create our faulty thinking, symptoms, and behaviors by using logic instead. Stoicism has also become popular in the world of business. Stoic principles can build the resilience and state of mind required to overcome setbacks because Stoics teach turning obstacles into opportunity. A lesson every business entrepreneur needs to learn. I would argue that studying Stoicism is as relevant today as it was 2,000 years ago, thanks to its brilliant insights into how to lead a good life. At the very root of the thinking, there is a very simple way of living. Control what you can, and accept what you can't. This is not as easy as it sounds, and will require considerable practice. It can take a lifetime to master. The Stoics also believed the most important foundation for a good and happy life is not money, fame, power, or pleasure, but having a disciplined and principled character, something which seems to resonate with many people today.",347.4211875,120.89072719550245,Ideal

ielts-listening-0004-cam19-test-1-part-4.wav,"For my presentation today, I'm going to talk about the KG fields in the northwest of Ireland, one of the largest, near-lithic sites in the world. I recently visited this site and observed the work that is currently being done by a team of archaeologists there. The site was first discovered in the 1930s by a local teacher, Patrick Callfield. He noticed that when local people were digging in the bog, they were constantly hitting against what seemed to be rows of stones. He realized that these must be walls, and that there must be thousands of years old for them to predate the bog which subsequently grew over them. He wrote to the National Museum in Dublin to ask them to investigate, but no one took him seriously. It wasn't until forty years later when Patrick Callfield's son, Shamus, who would become an archaeologist by then, began to explore further. He inserted iron probes into the bog to map the formation of the stones, a traditional method which local people had always used for finding fuel buried in the bog for thousands of years. And dating later proved that the site was over five thousand years old and was the largest near-lithic site in Ireland. Thanks to the bog which covers the area, the remains of the settlement at KG Fields, which is over five thousand years old, are extremely well preserved. A bog is ninety percent water. It's soil so saturated that when the grasses and feathers that grow on its surface die, they don't fully decay but accumulate in layers. Objects remain so well preserved in these conditions because of the acidity of the peat and the deficiency of oxygen. At least 175 days of rain a year are required for this to happen. This part of Ireland gets an average of 225 days. The near-lithic farmers at KG would have enjoyed several centuries of relative peace and stability. Near-lithic farmers generally lived in larger communities than their predecessors, with the number of houses built around a community building. As they lived in permanent settlements, near-lithic farmers were able to build bigger houses. These weren't round as people often assume, but rectangular, with a small hole in the roof that allowed smoke to escape. This is one of many innovations and indicates that the near-lithic farmers were the first people to cook indoors. Another new technology that near-lithic settlers brought to Ireland was pottery. Fragments of near-lithic pots have been found in KG and elsewhere in Ireland. The pots were used for many things, as well as for storing food. Pots were filled with a small amount of fat, and when this was set a light, they served as lamps. It's thought that the KG fields were mainly used as paddocks for animals to graze in. Evidence from the KG field suggests that each plot of land was of a suitable size to sustain an extended family. They may have used a system of rotational grazing in order to prevent overgrazing and to allow for plant recovery and regrowth. This must have been a year-round activity, as no structures have been found which would have been used to shelter animals in the winter. However, archaeologists believe that this way of life at KG ceased abruptly. Why was this? Well, several factors may have contributed to the changing circumstances. The soil would have become less productive and led to the abandonment of farming. The crop rotation system was partly responsible for this, as it would have been very intensive and was not sustainable. But there were also climatic pressures too. The farmers at KG would have enjoyed a relatively dry period, but this began to change, and the conditions became wetter as there was a lot more rain. It was these conditions that encouraged the bog to form over the area which survives today. So now I'd like to show you some.",277.371375,141.47097911599565,Ideal
short-stories-0192-193-the-protestant-reformation.wav,"The Protestant Reformation Until about 500 years ago, there was only one Christian church in Western and Central Europe. People from Portugal to Poland all belonged to the Roman Catholic Church. However, soon after the year 1500, people in many parts of Europe broke away from the Roman Catholic Church and began their own churches instead. This was known as the Protestant Reformation. The leader of the early Protestant movement was a German theologian named Martin Luther. Luther believed that many of the priests of the Roman Catholic Church had become too concerned about wealth and luxury. Also, he disapproved of some practices in the church. One such practice was that priests allowed people to pay money to the church in exchange for committing various sins. Luther believed that it was wrong to allow people to buy the freedom to commit acts that were against the teachings of the church. Luther began to criticize the Roman Catholic Church in public, and he refused to acknowledge the authority of the church. He said that instead he would follow the teachings of the Bible as he understood them. The officials of the church declared that Luther was a heretic. However, the local German rulers did not punish Luther. Many of them resented the power of the church and welcomed his ideas. Luther and other Protestant leaders disagreed with the church on several important issues. The Protestants believed that priests should be allowed to marry, whereas the Roman Catholic Church believed that priests should remain celibate. The Protestants believed that people should read the Bible for themselves, whereas the Roman Catholic Church believed that priests should interpret the Bible for the people. During the decades that followed Luther, the Protestant movement spread throughout much of Europe. Over time, many different Protestant churches were formed. During this period, many wars were fought between local rulers who favored Protestantism and other local rulers who supported the Roman Catholic Church. In the end, many parts of Europe became Protestant, such as Scandinavia, England, and parts of Germany, Holland, and Switzerland. However, the people and rulers of many other areas of Europe preferred to remain in the Roman Catholic Church. These areas included most of southern Europe, as well as Poland and Ireland. The Roman Catholic Church changed a few of its practices in response to Protestant criticism, but kept its most important beliefs. In recent times, relations between the Roman Catholic Church and the various Protestant churches have become much more friendly. Some discussions have been held between Catholic and Protestant officials in order to resolve some of their disagreements.",159.059625,163.71219283334787,Fast
short-stories-0258-261-casa-loma.wav,"Castleoma. Many people visit Europe and see the old castles left from the days of knighthood. Very few return home with plans to build their own castle. Toronto businessmen, Henry Pellet, actually built such a castle. Castleoma. Pellet was born in Kingston, Ontario in 1859, but the family soon moved to Toronto. His father opened Toronto's first stockbrokerage firm in 1866. Pellet Sr. became part of Toronto's financial elite, and Henry Pellet eventually joined his father in business. The young Pellet was especially attracted by the military and the British armed forces. When Henry was 18, he joined the Queen's own rifles, a militia unit. He was soon one of the soldiers sent to suppress a railway strike. At 21, he was made an officer and gradually moved up through the ranks, eventually becoming a Brigadier General. Meanwhile, Henry was learning the stockbrokerage business. He soon showed considerable ability at forming new companies. Electricity was a recent invention, and Pellet hoped to be among the foremost developers. In 1883, he founded the Toronto Electric Light Company, and later was an owner of the Toronto Electric Railway. He also made money as a land speculator in the Canadian West. Unlike many businessmen of the time, however, Pellet believed in community service. He sponsored many charitable organizations and supported various good causes. In spite of his business dealings, Pellet found time to tour England and Europe regularly. He brought back ideas for a castle on the hill. Pellet's castle, however, would not be a dab-drafty castle of the Middle Ages. It would have the latest technology. Construction of Castleoma began in 1910 and was completed in 1914. Outwardly, it looked like a medieval castle, but inside, it was comfortable and luxurious. There were 98 rooms, 3 bowling alleys, 30 bathrooms, 25 fireplaces, and 5,000 electric lights. It had an electric elevator and an indoor swimming pool. There was a library of 100,000 books, a temperature-controlled wine cellar, a shooting gallery, and a large art collection. Pellet ordered only the most expensive materials and employed the best craftsman. The cost of all of this was $3.5 million dollars, a huge sum in those days. Pellet and his wife, like to entertain, they often opened up Castleoma for special events. Sometimes, he would invite all 1,000 men from the Queen's own rifles over for the weekend. The Pellets also held parties for the staff. Pellet had hoped that Castleoma would be the center of an extensive subdivision. He hoped that wealthy people would build grand homes nearby, and so he bought up the land near his castle. Unfortunately for Pellet, most of the people coming to Toronto were poor immigrants who couldn't afford large houses. Pellet was unable to sell his land holdings, and his income declined. In 1924, Pellet turned Castleoma over to the city of Toronto because he could not pay his property tax. All the contents of Castleoma went on auction soon after. His $1.5 million collection of art and artifacts sold for only $250,000. Now Castleoma is a leading Toronto tourist attraction. The Castle in the middle of the city has 400,000 visitors each year. It is the closest thing in North America to a real European Castle.",223.08575,144.69772273666067,Ideal
Learn_English_Naturally.wav,"Learn English naturally. Most of us know intuitively that the best way is to learn English naturally. Yet, so many students still choose to use unnatural, ineffective, old methods of learning, and they continue to be frustrated. Why is it so scary for some students to switch to natural, effortless methods? The answer, of course, is our education system. All over the world, we have an industrial factory style of education. Students sit passively memorizing information through boring wrote. They listen passively to lectures and take notes. Anyone who understands the brain and how we learn knows that this factory education system is extremely ineffective. Learning in school is totally unnatural. So why are we taught this way? Because the central role of school is not to feed our minds. But to teach us to follow the rules and train us to be obedient employees. That's the sad truth. In fact, in some countries, some education officials in the government openly admit that they don't care if students develop English fluency. In Japan, for example, many officials say that the purpose of English class is not to learn English. But instead, to train students to be more disciplined. In other words, these officials believe that students become stronger by forcing themselves to memorize useless and boring information. It's no surprise that few Japanese students become fluent English speakers. Unless they learn English outside of the school system. Of course, Japan is not the only country with such a system. Very few school systems teach English naturally. What's even sadder is that private English conversation schools are strongly influenced by the government school systems. And so, in these private conversation schools, they still use textbooks, drills, and grammar memorization as their primary methods. To learn English naturally, you must leave the education system completely and become an independent learner. You must choose a listen first method and focus most of your energy and time on listening to understandable English. Listening is the foundation of natural English learning. It is the core skill, and you must master it before you focus on anything else. This does not mean, however, that you must be alone. While focusing on listening, you can still join an English learning community and communicate with other members. In our Effortless English Club, for example, members communicate on our forums and by talking to each other on Skype. They focus their study time on listening. But they still enjoy speaking and writing to each other socially. This natural learning community is fun, friendly, and energetic. The opposite of most school classrooms. There is no pressure, just friendly encouragement and support. This is the natural way to learn. Easily, effortlessly, socially, and independently. This is the way children naturally learn before they enter school. This is the way our brains are naturally designed for fastest and best learning. So there is nothing to fear. It is time. Leave the old education system. Let it go. Let go of the pressure, the stress, the fear, and the boredom. Become a natural, independent learner and learn English faster, more easily, and more enjoyable.",306.07675,102.13124649291395,Ideal

We're expecting this year's International Travel Exhibition to attract over 10,000 visitors a day ladies and gentlemen, and you are among the 200 extra staff recruited to help look after them. Now to help things run smoothly, we have divided you into four teams. The blue team, the green team, the red team and the yellow team. So first I'll explain how the teams are divided up and then we'll be giving you colour coded t-shirts so we can identify you more easily. First of all, those who will be looking after the phones and handling all calls regarding the Exhibition, you will be on the red team. Now we've also put the entrance staff on the red team and you'll be stamping the entrance tickets and giving out publicity leaflets, okay? Those of you involved in distributing entrance tickets will be on the yellow team and we've also put those of you who will be staffing the information booths around the conference centre on the yellow team. So you'll be getting a yellow t-shirt. Now most of the hospitality staff have been put in the blue team so the shifts among you and the kitchen hands will all need a blue t-shirt but because of the sheer numbers all waiting staff will be on the yellow team and this includes the bath staff among you. Those who will be monitoring and directing the traffic in the car parks are on the green team so you'll need to get a green t-shirt. This year we've also employed a considerable number of attendants to direct the human traffic around the conference centre. Now you'll be working in the exhibition hall at all times, giving directions and generally helping people whenever you can and you will be in the red team so please collect a red t-shirt. Right, now that everyone knows what team they're in we'll get on with the orientation and training programme and first I'll run through the rest of today's programme which you should have in front of you so that you can get a general idea of what else is in store today. This introduction finishes at 9.30 and then you'll be hearing from Anne Smith. Anne works in the accounts department on level 2 and she looks after all temporary staff and so she is the person to see if you have any problems regarding pay. Anne will be explaining when and how you get this. She will also be handing out your tax forms and I will just stress that all tax forms are in the same way. All tax forms must be completed and returned to Anne before your pay can be processed. Following Anne's talk you'll hear from Peter Chen, our conference manager and he will be going over a plan of the conference centre with you which will help you to orient yourselves. He will also go through the security arrangements with you and show you the fire exits. Then at 10.30 there will be a coffee break in the staff canteen which is located down on the ground floor. Now after the break we'll be moving to a different location for a video presentation so instead of coming back here we'd like you all to go to lecture room 311. You'll find it on the same level just down the hall and there you will be shown a video about important safety issues in the workplace called safety at work. We'll finish off the morning with lunch which should give everyone a chance to meet and get to know each other and we'll be serving you a buffet lunch in the main hall which is on the first floor from 12 o'clock. After lunch you'll be divided up into your teams to meet your team leaders and we're hoping to be all finished by three so I won't delay you any longer and I'll hand over.",256.73225,157.2844860744998,Fast

ielts-listening-0006-cam19-test-2-part-2.wav,"I never really planned to be a lifeboat volunteer when I came to live in North Sea. I'd been working in London as a website designer. But although that was interesting, I didn't like city life. I'd been really keen on boats as a teenager, and I thought if I went to live by the sea, I might be able to pursue that interest a bit more in my free time. Then I found that the lifeboat institution was looking for volunteers, so I decided to apply. The lifeboat institution building here in North Sea is hard to miss. It's one of the largest in the country. It was built 15 years ago, with funds provided by a generous member of the public who'd lived here all our life. As the lifeboat institution is a charity that relies on that kind of donation, rather than funding provided by the government, that was a huge help to us. When I applied, I had to have a health assessment. The doctors were particularly interested in my vision. I used to be short-sighted, so I'd had to work glasses, but I'd had laser eye surgery two years earlier so that was okay. They gave me test for colour blindness, and they thought I might have a problem there, but it turned out I was okay. When the coast guard gets an alert, all the volunteers are contacted and rushed to the lifeboat station. Our target's to get there in five minutes. Then we try to get the boat off the dock and out to sea in another six to eight minutes. Our teams proud that we usually achieve that. The average time across the country's eight and a half minutes. I've recently qualified as what's called a helmsman, which means I have the ultimate responsibility for the lifeboat. I have to check that the equipment we use is in working order. The crew have special life jackets that can support up to four people in the water, and it's ultimately my decision whether it's safe to launch the boat. But it's very rare not to launch it, even in the worst weather. As well as going out on the lifeboat, my work involves other things too. A lot of people underestimate how quickly conditions can change at sea, so I speak to youth groups and sailing clubs in the area about the sorts of problems that sailors and swimmers can have if the weather suddenly gets bad. We also have a lot of volunteers who organize activities to raise money for us, and we couldn't manage without them. The training we get is a continuous process, focusing on technical competence and safe handling techniques. It's given me the confidence to deal with extreme situations without panicking. I was glad I'd done a first aid course before I started, as that's a big help with the casualty care activities we do. We've done a lot on how to deal with ropes and tie knots, that's an essential skill. After a year, I did a one week residential course, led by specialists, they had a wave tank where they could create extreme weather conditions, so we could get experience of what to do if the boat turned over in a storm at night, for example. Since I started, I've had to deal with a range of emergency situations, but the work's hugely motivating. It's not just about saving lives. I've learned a lot about the technology involved. My background in IT has been useful here, and I can use my expertise to help other volunteers. They're a great group. We're like a family, really, which helps when you're dragging yourself out of bed on a cold stormy night. But actually, it's the colder months that can be the most rewarding time.

All the family can enjoy a day out at Manum, visit our copper mine, see models of the machinery it used, have your photo taken in 19th century costume, experience at first hand how people lived at different stages throughout history, and especially how children studied, worked, and played. The port of Manum is located in beautiful and peaceful countryside, on a bend in the Great River Aven, and developed here because it's the highest navigable point of the Aven. Boats can go no higher up this river, and proved a handy place to load and unload cargo to and from the sea, which is over 23 miles away. A small port was already established here, when about 900 years ago tin was discovered nearby, though it wasn't until the Industrial Revolution, when a tremendous need for metals of all kinds developed, that Manum expanded to become one of the busiest ports in the country. And because it was already so busy, prospectors began to look for other minerals, and by the end of the 19th century, lead, copper, manganese, and arsenic were added to the cargo's leaving Manum. In the early days, the oars had been smelted or processed in the same area they were mined. But as demand grew, the smelting process required huge factory furnaces or fires to melt the metal from the rock, and there was not enough coal in the local area, so the rocks containing minerals had to be shipped long distances. Sadly, in the 20th century, the great port of Manum declined, and thousands of workers were forced to emigrate out of the area. The building at the port fell into disrepair, and the place became almost forgotten. But then the Manum trust was formed to conserve the historical resources of the area. It organized scores of local volunteers to remove undergrowth to find the original outlines of the installations. It then brought in paid professionals to match installations with maps of the original port complex and to set about reconstructing it. Today you can see the results of this ambitious program of restoration. The intention, and we believe this will be realized before the end of the year, is to return Manum Port to the condition it reached at its peak, as the greatest copper port in the country. But what can you do and see on your visit today? Here are just a few highlights. We suggest you start with the visit to the copper mine. Travel on converted mining trains, and journey into the depths of the mountain, along seams once worked by hundreds of miners. Watch out especially for the great pumping machines which rid the mine of water. But please be warned that, like all mines, ours is very dark and closed in, and we do say that children under five, and also dogs, should not be taken into the mine. The next recommended visit is to the village school. While looking around the classrooms, take a special look at our display of games, which is one of the largest in the world. And it's recommended that you time your visit to coincide with a guided tour. This will give you the opportunity to ask lots of questions. Near the school is the beautiful old sailing catch called the George. You're welcome to board the boat and look round the cabins. Look out for the ship's wheel, which was missing until only five years ago when it was dredged out of the silt by a local fisherman. We have no idea how it got there, but it's been polished and proudly restored to its original place on the boat. Please take care going down the ladders if you wish to visit the lower deck. We don't recommend you allow young children to use them. So we hope you have a memorable visit to Manon Port, and we'll tell your friends all about us.",259.163375,154.88299610236209,Fast
ielts-listening-0114-cam12-test-1-part-2.wav,"Good morning, everyone. My name's Joy Parkins and I'm the restaurant manager. And I understand that none of you have had any previous experiences kitchen assistants. Well, you might be feeling a bit nervous now, but most of our kitchen assistants say they enjoy the work. Okay, they might get shouted at sometimes, but it's nothing personal. And they're pleased that they have so many different things to do, which means they never get bored. And I'll tell you straight away that if you do well, we might think about moving you up and giving you some more responsibility. Right. Well, you've all shown up on time, which is an excellent start. Now, I'm glad to see none of you have unsuitable footwear, so that's good. You need to be careful as the floors can get very wet and slippery. Those of you with long hair, I've got it well out of the way, but some of you all need to remove your rings and bracelets, just put them somewhere safer today and remember to leave them at home tomorrow as they can be a safety hazard. Now, it's going to be a busy day for you all today. We don't have any tables free for this evening and only a few for lunch. Fortunately, we've got our head chef back. He was away on holiday all last week, which meant the other chefs had extra work. Now, I'll tell you a bit more about the job in a minute, but first some general regulations. For all of you, whatever your age, there's some equipment you mustn't use until you've been properly trained, like the waste disposal system, for example, for health and safety reasons. Then I think there are two of you here who are under 18. That's Emma and Jake, isn't it? Right. So for you two, the meat slicer is out of bounds, and of course none of you are allowed to use the electric mixer until you've been shown how it works. Now, you may have heard that this can be a stressful job, and I have to say that can be true. You'll be working an eight hour day for the first week, though you'll have the chance to do overtime after that as well if you want to. But however long the hours are, you'll get a break in the middle. What you will find is that you're on your feet all day long, lifting and carrying. So if you're not fit now, you soon will be. You'll find you don't have much chance to take it easy when someone tells you to do something you need to do it straight away, but at least we do have a very efficient air conditioning system compared with some kitchens. Now, let me tell you about some of the people you need to know. So as I said, I'm Joy Parkins, and I decide who does what during the day and how long they work for. I'll be trying to get you to work with as many different people in the kitchen as possible so that you learn while you're on the job. One person whose name you must remember is David Field. If you injure yourself at all, even if it's really minor, you must report to him and he'll make sure the incident is recorded and you get the appropriate treatment. He's trained to give basic treatment to staff himself or he'll send you off somewhere else if necessary. Then there's Dexter Willes. He's the person you need to see if you smash a plate or something like that. Don't just leave it and hope no one will notice. It's really important to get things noted and replaced or there could be problems later. And finally, there's Mike Smith. He's the member of staff who takes care of all the stores of perishables. So if you notice we're getting low in flour or sugar or something, make sure you let him know so he can put in an order. Okay, now the next thing we need to call...",255.819125,160.42584775473685,Fast

ielts-listening-0154-cam10-test-3-part-2.wav,"Obviously its purpose is to protect dolphins in seas all around the world. It tries to raise people's awareness of the problems these marine creatures are suffering because of pollution and other threats. It started ten years ago and it's one of the fastest growing animal charities in the country, although it's still fairly small compared with the big players in animal protection. We're particularly proud of the work we do in education. Last year we visited a huge number of schools in different parts of the country, going round to talk to children and young people aged from 5 to 18. In fact about 35% of our members are children. The charity uses its money to support campaigns, for example for changes in fishing policy and so forth. It hopes soon to be able to employ its first full-time biologist with dolphin expertise to monitor populations. Of course many people give their services on a voluntary basis and we now have volunteers working in observation, office work and other things. I should also tell you about the award we won from the Charity Commission last year for our work in education. Although it's not meant an enormous amount of money for us, it has made our activities even more widely publicised and understood. In the long term it may not bring in extra members, but we're hoping it'll have this effect. Is it possible to see dolphins in UK waters? Yes, in several locations. And we have a big project in the east part of Scotland. This has long been a haven for dolphins because it has very little shipping. However, that may be about to change soon because oil companies want to increase exploration there. We're campaigning against this because although there'll be little pollution from oil, exploration creates a lot of underwater noise. It means the dolphins can't rest and socialise. This is how I became interested in dolphin conservation in the first place. I had never seen one and I hadn't been particularly interested in them at school. Then I came across this story about a family of dolphins who had to leave their home in the Moray Firth because of the oil companies and about a child who campaigned to save them. I couldn't put the book down. I was hooked. I'm sure our listeners will want to find out what they can do to help. You mentioned the adopted dolphin scheme. Can you tell us about that? Of course. People can choose one of our dolphins to sponsor. They receive a picture of it and news updates. I'd like to tell you about four which are currently being adopted by our members. Moon dancer, echo, kiwi and samsun. Unfortunately, echo is being rather elusive this year and hasn't yet been cited by our observers, but we remain optimistic that he'll be out there soon. All the others have been out in force. Samsun and Moon dancer are often photographed together, but it's kiwi who's our real character as she seems to love coming up close for the cameras and we've captured her on film hundreds of times. They all have their own personalities. Moon dancer is very elegant and curves out and into the water very smoothly, whereas samsun has a lot of energy. He's always leaping out of the water with great vigor. You'd probably expect him to be the youngest. He's not quite. That's kiwi. That's samsun's the latest of our dolphins to be chosen for the scheme. Kiwi makes a lot of noise so we can often pick her out straight away. Echo and Moon dancer are noisy too, but Moon dancer is easy to find because she has a particularly large fin on her back which makes her easy to identify. So yes, they're all very different.

Ds_discoussion.wav,"In this query, we can use HCeler index because if you use HCeler index, we can go for index only plan because this query use only a page attribute and salary attribute. So then without accessing employee table, directly can produce output from index file. So therefore, the query will use index. So then in your answer, you want to say it uses index only plan to produce output. That's one of the key points. So then if you start producing answer, it will first go through the index file. We'll go through the index file. Quarineet select greater than 40,000 entries, but can't find out. Select greater than 40,000 because it is sorted HY. It's a HCeler index. So therefore, entries in the index files are done HYs first and within this, it's a revised. So therefore, entire index leaf level have to scan to find out salary greater than 40,000 entries. So for the cost, scan in index leaf not, we want to add plus then query wants to group all entries HYs. So to group, actually, first of all, we want to sort data. But in this question, it is not necessary to sort data because index first attribute is H. So then system is reading data from, from disk to memory in a sorted order because HYs is already sorted. So therefore, no additional sort in the sort in cost become zero. So then for the query, next thing wants to do is calculate in average salary that's in memory operation, not skyverse. So therefore, to get the output of the total cost of the query, it just a matter of getting the index size. So if we know index size, we know the cost for the query. So how to find index size, you can see this table has four attributes, size of every attribute is given 10 by 20 bytes and so on. So then one record size is 40 by it, from one record, two attributes takes to producing index, H salary that is 10 bytes to and 8, 10 bytes. So then out of 40, 10 bytes goes for index from one record, then from 4000 pages, how much space takes to create index that you want to calculate. So out of 40, 10, then out of 4000, how much? So then it becomes 1000. So the index size is 1000 pages, so that's the cost for the part 10. So then part B is our skin, if we want to speed up this query further, what is the index, you are suggesting that's asking and asking us to justify the answer, then we'll have to estimate the cost again. So then only option available since already we are doing index only plan, we can just switch the order of attribute that is 8 salary previous index. Now you can say salary, 8 and 3 what is the cost. So then we are creating salary index on a employee table, that should be unclustered index because again it is index only plan. 8, then let's see how to estimate cost for this query with this unclustered index. If I write a cost formula at the end, so like now first attribute is salary.",306.364125,105.95235326590539,Ideal

This name setup helps users quickly find what they need making it much simpler to navigate. Next I will go to the edit profile page. It works fine but everything blends together making it hard to spot specific options. So I now re-design it with a clean and modern look. The new layout highlights important ones like save and cancer making it easier to update personal information. Now let's talk about my ad page. So I re-design with a clear image and key details easy to see. This makes the page less clutter and more user friendly. Lastly my ad page where all the information about each edition is re-design with simple icons and neatly organized sections. This helps users quickly find the important details without having to search through too much information. In summary these changes not only make the website look better but also make it easier to use. The improved design will help users find things more easily and encourage more engagement which could lead to more sales through better visibility and smooth navigation.

voice_mp3_01.wav,"You're not just talking about sexual activity. You're also talking about baseball. Because baseball is the dominant cultural metaphor that Americans use to think about and talk about sexual activity. And we know that because there's all this language in English that seems to be talking about baseball, but that's really talking about sexual activity. So for example, it could be a pitcher or a catcher and that corresponds to whether you perform a sexual act or receive a sexual act. Of course there are the bases which refer to specific sexual activities that happen in a very specific order. Ultimately resulting in a scoring a run or hitting a home run, which is usually having vaginal intercourse to the point of orgasm, at least for the guy. If you can strike out, which means you don't get to have any sexual activity. And if you're a bench wharmer, you might be a virgin or somebody for whom whatever reason isn't in the game. Maybe because of your age or because of your ability or because of your skill set. A batsapenus and a nappy dugout is a vulva or a vagina. A glove or a catcher is mid as a condom. A switch hitter is a bisexual person and we gain, let's be in folks, play for the other team. And then there's this one. If there's grass on the field, play ball. And that usually refers to if a young person specifically often a young woman is old enough to have pubic hair, she's old enough to have sex with. This baseball model is incredibly problematic. It's sexist, it's heterosexist, it's competitive, it's goal directed. And it can't result in healthy sexuality developing in young people or in adults. So we need a new model. I'm here today to offer you that new model. And it's based on pizza. Now pizza is something that is universally understood and that most people associate with a positive experience. So let's do this. Let's take baseball and pizza and compare it when talking about three aspects of sexual activity. The trigger for sexual activity, what happens during sexual activity and the expected outcome of sexual activity. So when do you play baseball? You play baseball when it's baseball season and when there's a game on the schedule. It's not exactly your choice. So if it's prom night or a wedding night or at a party or if our parents are in a home. Hey, it's just better up. Can you imagine saying to your coach, uh, not really feeling it today. I think I'll sit this game out. That's just not the way it happens. And when you get together to play baseball, immediately you were two opposing teams. One playing offense, one playing defense. And somebody's trying to move deeper into the field. That's usually assigned to the boys. Somebody's trying to defend people moving into the field. That's often given to the girl. It's competitive. We're not playing with each other. We're playing against each other. And when you show up to play baseball, nobody needs to talk about what we're going to do or how this baseball game might be good for us. Everybody knows the rules. You just take your position and play the game. But when do you have pizza? Well, you have pizza when you're hungry for pizza. It starts with an internal sense, an internal desire or a need, huh? I could go for some pizza. And because it's an internal desire, we actually have some sense of control over that. I can decide that I'm hungry, but know that it's not a great time to eat. And then when we get together for someone for pizza, we're not competing with them. We're looking for an experience that both of us will share that that's satisfying for both of us. And when you get together for pizza with somebody, what's the first thing you do? You talk about it. You talk about what you want. You talk about what you like. You may even negotiate. How do you feel about pepperoni? Not so much. I'm kind of a mushroom guy myself. Well, maybe we can go half and half. And even if you've had pizza with somebody for a very long time, don't you still say things like, should we get the usual? Or maybe something a little more adventurous. Okay, so when you're playing baseball, so if you talk about during sexual activity, when you're playing baseball, you're just supposed to round the bases in the proper order one at a time. You can't hit the ball and run through right field. That doesn't work. And you also can't get to second base and say, I like it here. I'm going to stay here. No. And also, of course, with baseball, there's like the specific equipment and a specific skill set. Not everybody can play baseball. It's pretty exclusive. Okay, but what about pizza? When we're trying to figure out what's good for pizza, isn't it all about what's our pleasure? There are a million different kinds of pizza. There's a million different toppings. There's a million different ways to eat pizza. And none of them are wrong. They're different. And in this case, difference is good. Because that's going to increase the chance that we're having a satisfying experience. And lastly, what's the expected outcome of baseball? Well, in baseball, you play to win. You score as many runs as you can. There's always a winner in baseball. And that means there's always a loser in baseball. But what about pizza? Well, in pizza, we're not really... There's no winning. How do you win pizza? You don't. But you do look for, are we satisfied? And sometimes that can be different amounts over different times or with different people or in different days. And we get to decide when we feel satisfied. If we're still hungry, we might have some more. If you eat too much, though, you just feel gross. So what if we could take this pizza model and overlay it on top of sexuality education? A lot of sexuality education that happens today is so influenced by the baseball model. And it sets up education that can't help but produce unhealthy sexuality in young people. And those young people become older people. But if we could create sexuality education that was more like pizza, we could create education that invites people to think about their own desires, to make deliberate decisions about what they want, to talk about it with their partners, and to ultimately look for not some external outcome, but for what feels satisfying. And we get to decide that. You may have noticed in the baseball on pizza comparison, under the baseball, it's all commands. They're all exclamation points. But under the pizza model, they're questions. And who gets to answer those questions? You do. I do. So remember, when we're thinking about sexuality education and sexual activity, baseball, you're out. Pizza is the way to think about healthy, satisfying, sexual activity, and good comprehensive sexuality education. Thank you very much for your time.",473.02,151.95974800219864,Fast

He tells us where the weather will be nice and where it will be bad. The weatherman is not always right. Weather reporting is not an exact science. Nothing is very exact when it comes to the weather. The weather department does a lot of research, but they can never be sure of exactly what will happen. Sometimes it looks like it will be clear, but the wind changes direction and clouds move in. The weathermen can warn people if there is a chance of a hurricane or tornado. The weathermen can also warn people of floods. Sometimes entire towns have to be evacuated because of bad weather. It is important to be aware of the weather. For example, it is not good to be caught in the middle of a field when there is going to be a thunderstorm. You might want to take extra precautions if there is going to be a heavy snowstorm. You would need to be in a secure place if a hurricane or tornado was predicted. You might want to cancel a picnic if you knew that it would rain that day. The weather affects us in so many ways. Some people are really affected by dull, cloudy days. If there are no sunny days, they become very depressed. Heavy air pressure can cause some people to have headaches. Weather affects all of us in one way or another.

short-stories-0235-237-texas.wav,"Texas. The state of Texas is famous for having the biggest and best of everything. Before Alaska became a state, Texas was the largest American state. It was also famous for its huge cattle ranches. Cotton is a major crop, but much of the wealth comes from oil and gas. People think of Texans as being wealthy because there have been lots of cattle and oil millionaires. In the late 19th century, Texas cattlemen used to drive their herds north to Kansas. There a train to the east shipped the cows. Eventually, the railroad came to Texas and the great cattle drive stopped. By then, many Texans owned large ranches and were quite wealthy. In the 20th century, oil has made many Texans wealthy. Oil refining has led to chemical industries and synthetic products. Most Texans now live in cities. Many oil companies have their headquarters in Dallas. Other large manufacturing cities are Houston, Corpus Christi, Fort Worth, and Austin, which is the capital of Texas. Several cities such as San Antonio and El Paso have a strong Spanish influence. This dates back to the first Spanish visitors in the 16th century. The old mission at San Antonio is famous as the Alamo, where an important battle for Texas independence was fought. Texas is a huge area with mountains, deserts, prairies, rivers, and islands. The rugged beauty of its grasslands and deserts attracts many tourists. For a state that is mostly dry, Texas has a remarkable variety of wildflowers in the spring. Its animals and birds differ from other parts of the USA. Texas has the armored insect eater, the Armadillo, the swift running bird, the road runner, frery dogs, jackrabbits, kangaroo rats, wild pigs, horned lizards, and 100 species of snakes. As might be expected also, it has many beautiful kinds of cacti and other desert plants. At its largest, Texas is more than 600 miles wide by 600 miles long. Such a large area develops a distinct culture of its own, and Texans are widely recognized by their accent and manner of speaking, their attitudes and interests, and their sense of independence and self-reliance. Texas is also known for its beautiful women, who regularly win national beauty contests. Its men have a reputation for being rugged, for not talking more than they have to, and for being straightforward and honest. Although many people think of cowboys and Indians when they think of Texas, it is a center for high-tech industries. The American Space Program has its headquarters in Houston, and Mission Control Center is there. Texas is also an important manufacturer of computers and other high-tech products. Oil production is still important in Texas, but it ranks third as a source of revenue behind manufacturing and tourism. The colorful history of Texas and its wonderful scenery contribute to a thriving tourist industry. Texas is also an important business and financial area. Yes, even though times have changed, Texans proudly maintain that their state still has the biggest and best of everything.",196.20575,153.81812204790126,Fast

ielts-listening-0218-cam6-test-3-part-2.wav,"Welcome everybody to the lovely house and gardens of Rosewood, once the home of the famous writer Sebastian George. He bought the house in 1902, although he had first seen it two years earlier. At that time the owners let it out to a tenant because George was too slow making up his mind to buy it. When it came back on the market there was no hesitation and he bought it immediately for £9,300. Even though the house had no bathroom, no running water upstairs and no electricity. When he came here he had been married for ten years. During that time he had become one of the most famous writers in the English-speaking world. His professional success was enormous but his personal life wasn't as successful. He was no longer on speaking terms with his brother and had been devastated by the death at the age of seven of his elder daughter Josephine. Moving to Rosewood allowed the family to start a new life. George regarded Rosewood as a pure example of a traditional country house of this part of England and it's some of his most successful writing here. The house and its grounds became the family haven and their escape to privacy and quiet. The walls and the mullion windows were built of the local sandstone. The tiles on the roofs and the bricks of the chimney stack were baked from local clay and the wooden structures inside came from oak trees which grow around here. Now please look at the map I've given you of the house and gardens. We're here at the Information Centre. Follow the path marked with the arrow and the first area you come to is the orchard on your left. As you go further down the path there's the kitchen garden on the right and as you go round the first sharp corner you will find to your left an area where different types of pear tree have been planted as well as some lovely flowers and this is known as pear alley designed by George himself. Next to this is the greenhouse where some exotic plants and fruits are grown. Follow the path round the second corner and on your right you will see the entrance to the mulberry garden with its 500 year old tree. Next to the mulberry garden follow the path until you reach the front of the house. I suggest you spend a good hour wandering around this lovely building. A guide takes visitor groups round every two hours. If you would like to purchase any of George's books or other souvenirs then leave the house by the side entrance where you will find our shop which is situated between the house and the garage which contains the magnificent old Rolls Royce car which used to belong to George. I expect by this time you may also be in need of a rest and some refreshment. Most visitors are so why don't you visit the tearum on the far side of the garage. If you have time there is a lovely walk down towards the river dudwell. For me this is the best part of the estate. This isn't on the map but it is all clearly signposted. You cross the field which spreads along the banks of the river. In spring this area is well worth a visit. Spend a minute or two watching the water pass by underneath as you cross the footbridge and then continue along the river walk through the woodland. On a hot summer's day the trees along this path provide welcome shade. Eventually you come to the water mill which used to provide the electricity for the house. Only about four hours every evening in George's time. And finally for those of you who would like to see stunning views of the surrounding countryside and who are a little bit more energetic when you return from the mill take the first turning on your left and climb up to the viewpoint. You won't regret it. Enjoy your visit.",264.3665,154.10424543200443,Fast
ielts-listening-0326-ielts-recent-actual-test-34-part-2.wav,"Hi everyone and welcome to Sydney Airport. Today I'll be giving you the inside information on the day-to-day operations of the Australian quarantine service here. We hope to provide you with a better understanding of why such heavy security regulations are necessary by educating you on how we operate and why we do the things we do. We're not here to try to persuade you to fly through Sydney Airport that we hope you'll find your experience relatively stress-free and comfortable. First things first are personnel. Can anyone guess how many people work at Sydney Airport? We have 200 alone working in terminal two so can you guess how many in the whole airport? I heard someone say 360 that's getting closer. What? Did someone say 2000? That's way too high. Sydney Airport actually employs 440 people. A lot, right? And about half of those employees work in security related matters. Moving on to our not-so-human employees, let's come and see our favourite pooch, Milton. Milton is our best drug-sniffing dog on the force. He's friendly to most people, you can even come pet him at the end of our tour. Burnouts, beware though, he'll find everything. Notice that even though there are so many of us around him, Milton stays quite calm. This is the precise reason he was chosen for the job. Dogs that are chosen are not predisposed to sniff out different narcotics. That's something we teach them already. So here's a part of the airport most people never notice. The cargo transport terminal. This is where packages are shipped to and from. Normally we ship around 4400 packages per month. In this airport alone, over 52 000 packages were shipped in and out over the past year. We ship to and from 170 different countries, not bad, eh? Probably it will go up to over 72 000 packages this year. And despite over 100 flights in and out of here daily, the number of lost or delayed packages is impressively low. If you send your package through here, rest assured we'll get it where it's going. Let's move on to the area most of us are familiar with the passenger terminals. In order to be allowed into this area, you must pass through security with your ticket and if you're travelling internationally, you're passbord. If you're travelling domestically, you just need a legal form of ID. If you don't have those, you will not be allowed to pass through security and board your flight. During the security scan, your carry-on items will be checked for dangerous items such as weapons, sharp objects and liquids that exceed our specified limit. If you attempt to pass any of the prohibited items on this list posted at the entrance, you are still allowed to board a plane, but you'll be given a warning and your item will be confiscated. Don't worry, we will not arrest you for having too much shampoo in your bag or anything like that. We also search your carry-ons and parcels for any perishable items. We prohibit the transportation of local vegetation and prohibit parcels containing any insects in them. You may or may not have learnt about this in biology class, but when some plants are introduced to a new environment, they spread wildly and wipe out the current species around it. It is important to control the introduction of new plants into an ecosystem, so we must prohibit the transport of any fertile seeds. So what happens to parcels containing possibly suspicious items? It's of course something we do not take lightly here. If an object passes through the scanner that appears suspicious in any way, it is separated out for manual search by a member of our trained security personnel. If an illegal plant or simple, sharp object like a pocket knife is found, it is simply disposed of in our bio-hazard waste containers, and the package itself is returned to the sender, or passenger if it is for a passenger flight. More serious weapons are reported to hire authorities for investigation. As far as parcel security, the material of the parcel is important. For shipped goods, the most common material used and the most widely accepted is paper. Make sure it is packed sturdy enough with no rips or tears. We've definitely had packages rip open before due to haphazard packing. A more common problem though is the package labels. When an item does not make it to the right place, this is the most common reason. The label may not be in the right place or marked clearly enough. If you're receiving any items from a broad that must be declared, please remember our guidelines in order to ensure the time nid delivery of your item. Make sure it is packed correctly, and we ask that you notify customs between two and ten days within the item's schedule to rival date. Okay, before we move on, are there any questions?",313.6869375,158.7570091279303,Fast
Lecture 1 Audio.wav,"Hi everybody, I can see you're all settled in. Okay, and so why don't we get started? Today I want to talk to you about Bill Gates. Now I know who Bill Gates is. You know him as the founder of Microsoft, and you probably know him as a multi-billionaire who's still at the top of the world's richest list every year. But we're also going to be talking about Bill Gates, not just the entrepreneur and the computer programmer, but also the philanthropist who is involved with something called philanthropicapitalism. Yeah, you can see from the look on your faces that is a mouthful. And hopefully by the end of this talk, you'll not only know what philanthropicapitalism is, but you'll also be able to say it. Okay, so first I want to start out a little bit with his background. Bill Gates was born in 1955 in Seattle, Washington, in the northwest of the United States. He comes from a very affluent family. His father who is still alive is a very successful lawyer. And his mother was a schoolteacher, a businesswoman, and a philanthropist herself who worked for many decades on the board of United Way. And she also served on the boards of several other organizations in this city of Seattle. So perhaps she set the tone for Bill Gates and his future of philanthropy. Who knows? Okay, so first I want to give you a little bit of background on his education. So when he was 13, he started to attend the elite preparatory school lakeside in Seattle. And that's pretty much where his, I'd say, love affair with computers started and his obsession with software programming. The school bought a thing called a teletype model 33 ASR terminal and then they booked some time with general electric computer, which is what you had to do in those days to get computer time. The school was helping to increase the students opportunities to use these new computers. Bill Gates was so excited and so good at doing this programming that he often became excused from his math classes so that he could actually spend more time programming. The first program that he wrote on this terminal was a game of Tic Tac Toe against the machine. So that's how he started off. So basically Bill Gates was clearly a very gifted student. He achieved an SAT score for example of 1590 out of 1600, which is awfully impressive. And then he gained admission to Harvard University. So I'm sure his parents imagined a very bright academic future for him. But like any parent knows, things don't always go the way you hope for your children. And after just two years he decided to drop out of Harvard. And probably wondering why that's a pretty rationing to do. According to him, he felt that with the timing of what was going on in the world of computers and with the ideas that he had, he couldn't wait out the next two years before he took the opportunity to jump on this new bandwagon. Now of course in recent years he regularly makes a point of telling college students whenever he's speaking to them, you know, as he tours schools around the US that dropping out of school is not a good idea, but for him that obviously worked out well. Now I don't want you guys to go to your parents with this and say, well Bill Gates dropped out so so can I. Like he told the economic times at the University of Chicago in 2010, he always explains to these students, don't even think about leaving your college without a very, very unique idea that fills a very specific niche. So let's talk about Microsoft now just a little bit. So he started Microsoft with his childhood friend Paul Allen in the year 1975. The rest of course is history. He went on to become one of the greatest innovators and wealthiest men on the planet, a true giant in the fields of computer programming and software. But what I want to focus on now is what I call his second life purpose. The purpose is philanthropy capitalism. So in the year 2000 Bill Gates decided to leave his position of CEO at Microsoft and by the year 2008 he had left the company completely. He does continue on as chairman and technical director to this day, but as far as the day to day running of the company, he has no direct involvement. Now his leadership style is sometimes criticized for being too rough and Microsoft was regularly dealing with litigation for many years. But most people know about that. What I think is far more interesting is that around this time he and his wife Melinda decided to form the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. So what does the foundation do? It's some main focus is on AIDS, malaria, extreme poverty and the US education system. They state their mission as this. They want to mix technological advances of our modern society to help those in the society who need it most but benefit from that technology the least. And they have a really simple but I think really profound slogan. All lives have equal value. Okay, so that's what they're working from. In 2010 they sat down with journalist Cristiana Mapport and talked about the foundation. She asked how they chose these issues as their primary focus. And they explained that good health has a stabilizing effect on the population. And when they looked at the US they wanted to focus on education because they felt that the greatest inequity that they could see in the US was in education. And that they felt that not every child in the nation was getting a phenomenal education, the education that they deserved. So that's how they decided to focus on those areas. Now when Bill Gates was visiting MIT and speaking to students he famously asked are the brightest minds working on the most important problems. We have lots of talent that could be shifted at least to some degree from sports, entertainment, investing or in the area of innovation but a lot of that focuses on the needs of the rich. Again, not the people who need it the most. So you're still wondering I'm sure what is philanthropy capitalism. So first of all let's look at philanthropy. So we know that philanthropy is the act of giving to or doing something for poor people or those who need help or giving to a good cause. A philanthropic capitalist is a business person primarily who believes that business should not just be about profit but that business has a moral duty to give back to the society that gave it so much. Entrepreneurs are better poised through their extensive business skills and their background in business to deliver philanthropy in a way that maybe will be more efficient or specific than government programs alone. This regularly cites vaccines as one of the best forms of global investment in giving. So he sees this as offering up the best return. I.e. the best chance of saving lives especially young lives at the lowest cost. So as you see in that example he applies business principles to his choices in philanthropy. One of the most interesting things related to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is the giving pledge. So this is something that Bill Gates and legendary financier Warren Buffett formed in 2010. The giving pledge works like this. Basically they focus on billionaires. Excuse me. They get them to agree to give away at least half of their wealth to philanthropic causes within their lifetimes or after their deaths. Now this pledge is really just a verbal promise. They don't sign a contract and they do however make a very public commitment to give away the majority of their fortunes. So for example on their website they have a long list of the people who have agreed to this pledge and includes names like Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and a brief explanation from each person who has not signed on but agreed to this pledge. It gives an explanation of why they've chosen to do that. So far they have managed to sign up just under 100 American billionaires which is quite amazing when you think about the fact that it's only been going on since 2010 and now they're starting to focus on China and other countries where there's a lot of wealth being generated. So Warren Buffett himself has pledged 75% of his fortune which is about $31 billion in shares and he's going to give that out over several years. So starting around this time and that will all be given directly to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. One of the main goals that Bill and Melinda Gates have for their foundation is that of inspiration. They really want to inspire others in society, the very wealthy like themselves but also everyday people to give back either financially or to give their time. So they want to remind us that even though the US has a strong history of philanthropy that everyone should still be involved in giving back in some form. Now some people are uncomfortable with basing philanthropy on a business model approach but really philanthropists themselves don't worry about that. They just get on with impacting lives of people in the world in the best way that they can. So now that you know what philanthropy capitalism is, I want to end this talk by posing a question for yourselves to ponder. So when you go off into the wider world and you make your first million and then your first billion if you're very talented and have a lot of luck, will you remember this discussion? And will you remember philanthropicapolis and do you feel like it would make you think more about giving some of your money back or some of your time to those who need it? So Billy Melinda Gates really hope that you will to them it's really a moral imperative. Okay, so what I'd like you to do for your assignment tonight is could you read chapter seven on philanthropy capitalism and then I'd like you to write a response to the questions at the end. Okay, thank you everybody.",944.377375,110.67609492444691,Ideal
short-stories-0276-280-the-florida-everglades.wav,"The Florida Everglades Southern Florida stretches south, dividing the Atlantic Ocean from the Gulf of Mexico. Stretching further south is the Florida Keys. These coral islands are the southernmost part of the United States. Since much of Southern Florida is close to sea level, it's very swampy. The famous Everglades are wetlands where tall grass and bunches of trees grow. Part of these swamps has been drained for agriculture land. The soil is rich, and market gardening is an important activity. The Everglades that remain are too wet to be used for farming. The Everglades are a river of grass. The deeper water areas stay wet all year, but the shallower pools dry up in the dry season. Some of the water has been drained off for agricultural purposes, making the Everglades drier. Nonetheless, the best way to travel in this region is by air boats. These high boats can go through water and sail over clumps of grass. As the wet grasslands, Southern Florida has smaller areas of tropical forest. These areas of hardwood trees are called hammocks, and they are rich in animal and plant life. Along much of the coast are mangrove trees, which provide important nesting grounds for wild birds. The Florida Keys stretch 200 miles from Miami, Southwest. These islands are tropical and climate. Fishing and tourism are important industries. Because of its subtropical nature, the animal and plant life of Southern Florida differs from other parts of the United States. Characteristic animals are alligators and crocodiles. Alligators prefer freshwater and usually live inland while crocodiles live in saltwater along the coast. Both animals are considered dangerous. Alligator wrestling is considered a sport for the brave or foolhardy. Probably Florida is the most famous for its birds. At one time, many species were almost extinct. Their long feathers were used on women's hats. Now the law protects them. Florida has at least six species of herons, several egrets, woodstorks, white ibises, and cormorants. Characteristic Florida birds are the purple galanule, the eninga, the limpkin, flamingos, and rosy at spoonbills. Many of these birds are notable for their size, coloring, and interesting habits. Notable animals include the key deer, a miniature form of the white tail deer. They're also panthers or cougars, bobcats, marsh rabbits, mangrove squirrels, round-tail muskrats, and the manatee. Naturally, the Everglades are home to many reptiles. Snakes are common, both water snakes and land species. There are four poisonous varieties. Both land and sea turtles abound and lizards are fairly common. Fishing is a major industry. Sports fishermen go to sea in search of trophies such as Marlin, Sailfish, and Tarpawn. Smaller fish are caught commercially. Freshwater sport fish include bass and gar. After many decades of work to protect the animals and plants of the Everglades, the region finally became a national park in 1947. It is the third largest park in the USA and covers one and a half million acres. Within the park live 300 kinds of birds, 30 kinds of mammals, 65 kinds of reptiles and amphibians, and nearly 1,000 species of flowering plants. Of course, it is a major tourist attraction.",193.3845,162.5776626358369,Fast

short-stories-0253-256-the-two-cultures.wav,"The Two Cultures In 1956, English writer and scientist C. P. Snow wrote an essay on The Two Cultures. By this, he met that in the West, there's a scientific culture and a literary culture. Scientists do not talk very much to literary men and vice versa. Neither group seems to know or want to know very much about the other. Snow argues that the scientific people and the literary people are moving further and further apart. Few scientists or engineers read literature. Very few writers or intellectuals know or care anything about science. This Snow thinks is a major problem in the world today. Lovary culture seems to be anti-science and anti-technology. This affects Western reluctance to train more scientists and engineers. The standard of living in the West and throughout the world depends on having scientists and engineers. Nonetheless, relatively little effort is given to encouraging and developing these areas of education. Westerners who are part of a literary culture do not encourage or understand the scientific revolution. As a result, they are insensitive to the desire of third world peoples to improve their lives through technology. Snow talks about how the standard of living in England has improved since 1800. Snow's grandfather did not go far in school, but he did learn to read and write. Living in 1900, he realized that he was better off than his grandfather who lived in the early 1800s. Snow's great-great grandfather was a farm laborer who didn't know how to read or write. Snow feels that a similar transformation could happen even in very poor countries. It could happen in a short time if the West supplied capital and engineers. Snow believes that this is the industrial revolution that has transformed the West. This is what has allowed the farm laborers to go on to school and to learn employable skills. In 1800, only a small portion of society could expect to live well. Now nearly everyone has access to education and training. The same industrial revolution can happen in third world countries. It is the only way to improve the lot of the poor. Snow agrees that most scientists and engineers do not read novels or cultivate the arts. However, he doesn't consider this to be as dangerous as when literary people ignore science and technology. Science and technology are too important to our standard of living to be ignored. Our education systems have to be changed to reflect our need of them. Snow's article was quite controversial. Not everyone agreed with him that science and technology are being ignored by our educational system. But Snow certainly has a point when he says that scientific people and literary people view the world differently. These two different mindsets often lead to conflict in the workplace. Snow may be right that it is too easy for literary-minded students to ignore science and scientifically-minded students to ignore literature.",191.9216875,151.93697168799645,Fast
short-stories-0079-79-emotions.wav,"Emotions Do you ever think about your emotions? What kinds of things make you sad? I get sad when I get a bad mark in school, or when someone that I like moves away. I sometimes see sad movies that make me cry. I don't like to be sad. I don't like to have a frown on my face. I like to be happy. I'm happy most of the time. Parties make me happy. Being with my friends makes me happy. Lots of things make me happy. If someone tells me a joke, I laugh. I enjoy laughing.

ielts-listening-0034-cam17-test-1-part-2.wav,"So, hello everyone, my name is Lou Miller and I'm going to be your tour guide today, as we take this fantastic boat trip around the Tasmanian coast. Before we set off, I just want to tell you a few things about our journey. Our boats aren't huge as you can see, we already have three staff members on board, and on top of that we can transport a further 15 people, that's you, around the coastline. But please note, if there are more than nine people on either side of the boat, we'll move some of you over. Otherwise all 18 of us will end up in the sea. We've recently upgraded all our boats. They used to be jet black, but our new ones now have these comfortable dark red seats and a light green exterior in order to stand out from others and help promote our company. This gives our boats a rather unique appearance, don't you think? We offer you a free lunchbox during the trip, and we have three types. Lunchbox 1 contains Hammond Tomato sandwiches. Lunchbox 2 contains a cheddar cheese roll, and lunchbox 3 is salad based, and also contains eggs and tuna. All three lunchboxes also have a packet of crisps and chocolate bar inside. Please let staff know which lunchbox you prefer. I'm sure I don't have to ask you not to throw anything into the sea. We don't have any bins to put litter in, but Jess, myself or Ray, our other guide, will collect it from you after lunch and put it all in a large plastic sack. The engine on the boat makes quite a lot of noise, so before we head off, let me tell you a few things about what you're going to see. This area is famous for its ancient lighthouse, which you'll see from the boat as we turn past the first little island. It was built in 1838 to protect sailors as a number of shipwrecks had led to significant loss of life. The construction itself was complicated as some of the original drawings kept by the local council show. It sits right on top of the cliffs in a very isolated spot. In the 19th century there were many jobs there, such as polishing the brass lamps, chopping firewood and cleaning windows that kept lighthouse keepers busy. These workers were mainly prison convicts until the middle of that century when ordinary families willing to live in such circumstances talk over. Some of you have asked me what creatures we can expect to see. I know everyone loves the penguins, but they're very shy and unfortunately tend to hide from passing boats, but you might see birds in the distance, such as seagulls, flying around the cliff edges where they nest. When we get to the rocky area inhabited by first seals, we'll stop and watch them swimming around the coast. They're inquisitive creatures, so don't be surprised if one pops up right in front of you. Their predators, walker whales hunt along the coastline too, but spotting one of these is rare. Dolphins, on the other hand, can sometimes approach on their own or in groups as they ride the waves beside us. Lastly, I want to mention the caves. Tasmania is famous for its caves and the ones will pass by are so amazing that people are lost for words when they see them. They can only be approached by sea, but if you feel that you want to see more than we're able to show you, then you can take a kayak into the area on another day and one of our staff will give you more information on that. What we'll do is to go through a narrow channel, past some incredible rock formations, and from there we'll be able to see the openings to the caves, and at that point we'll talk to you about what lies beyond.",270.0335625,146.64843745117795,Ideal

ielts-listening-0074-cam15-test-3-part-2.wav,"Well, I first had the idea when my oldest child was still a toddler. So that's about, oh, six years ago now, but it took at least two years of campaigning before we were actually able to make it happen. So the scheme's been up and running for three years now. We'd love to be able to close our road for longer for the whole weekend from Saturday morning until Sunday evening, for example. At the moment is just once a week, but when we started, it was only once a month, but we're working on it. So what actually happens when Beachwood Road is closed? We have volunteer wardens, mostly parents, but some elderly residents too, who block off our road at either end. The council have provided special signs, but there's always a volunteer there to explain what's happening to any motorists. Generally, they're fine about it. We've only had to get the police involved once or twice. Now, I should explain that the road isn't completely close to cars, but only residents cars are allowed. If people really need to get in or out of Beachwood Road, it's not a problem as long as they drive at under 20 kilometres per hour. But most people just decide not to use their cars during this time, all they park in another street. The wardens are only there to stop through traffic. So can anyone apply to get involved in street play? Absolutely. We want to include all kids in the city, especially those who live on busy roads. It's here that demand is greatest. Obviously, there isn't such demand in wealthier areas where the children have access to parks or large gardens, or in the suburbs where there are usually more places for children to play outside. I'd recommend that anyone listening who likes the idea should just give it a go. We've been surprised by the positive reaction of residents all over the city, and that's not just parents. There are always a few who complain, but there are tiny minority. On the whole, everyone is very supportive and say they're very happy to see children out on the street, even if it does get quite noisy. There have been so many benefits of street play for the kids. Parents really like the fact that the kids are getting fresh air instead of sitting staring at a computer screen, even if they're not doing anything particularly energetic. And of course, it's great that kids can play with their friends outside without being supervised by their parents. But for me, the biggest advantage is that kids develop confidence in themselves to be outside without their parents. The other really fantastic thing is that children get to know the adults in the street. It's like having a big extended family. It certainly does have a lot of benefits. I want to move on now and ask you about a related project in King Street. Right. Well, this was an experiment I was involved in, where local residents decided to try and reduce the traffic along King Street, which is the busiest main road in our area, by persuading people not to use their cars for one day. We thought about making people pay more for parking, but we decided that would be really unpopular. So instead, we just stopped people from parking on King Street, but left the other car parks open. It was surprising how much of a difference all this made. As we predicted, air quality was significantly better. But what I hadn't expected was how much quieter it would be, even with the buses still running. Of course, everyone said they felt safer, but we were actually amazed that sales in the shops went up considerably that day. We thought there'd be fewer people out shopping, not...",240.745375,159.75384781535263,Fast

If you have questions of a general nature rather than one relating to specific destinations you can go there. Now as I said we can do international tours and for that you need our big office just through that door the one between those two plants. However if your international tours in the Asian region which is generally our most popular option then we deal with that in a separate room. The one opposite international tours but not the corner one. Just go through that door on the left the one next to that cupboard.

ielts-listening-0078-cam15-test-4-part-2.wav,"As chair of the Town Council Subcommittee on Park Facilities, I'd like to bring you up to date on some of the changes that have been made recently to the Croft Valley Park. So if you could just take a look at the map I handed out, let's begin with a general overview. So the basic arrangement of the park hasn't changed. It still has two gates, north and south and a lake in the middle. The cafe continues to serve an assortment of drinks and snacks and is still in the same place, looking out over the lake and next to the old museum. We're hoping to change the location of the toilets and bring them nearer to the centre of the park as they're a bit out of the way it present near the adventure playground in the corner of your map. The formal gardens have been replanted and should be at their best in a month or two. They used to be behind the old museum but we've now used the space near the Southgate between the park boundary and the path that goes past the lake towards the old museum. We have a new outdoor gym for adults and children which is already proving very popular. It's by the glass houses just to the right of the path from the Southgate. You have to look for it as it's a bit hidden in the trees. One very successful introduction has been our skate board ramp. It's in constant use during the evenings and holidays. It's near the old museum at the end of a little path that leads off from the main path between the lake and the museum. We've also introduced a new area for wild flowers to attract bees and butterflies. It's on a bend in the path that goes around the east side of the lake just south of the adventure playground. Now let me tell you a bit more about some of the changes to Croft Valley Park. One of our most exciting developments has been the adventure playground. We were aware that we had nowhere for children to let off steam and decided to use our available funds to set up a completely new facility in a large space to the north of the park. It's open year round, though it closes early in the winter months and entrance is completely free. Children can choose whatever activities they want to do irrespective of their age, but we do ask adults not to leave them on their own there. There are plenty of seats where parents can relax and keep an eye on their children at the same time. Lastly, the glasshouses. A huge amount of work has been done on them to repair the damage following the disastrous fire that recently destroyed their western side. Over £80,000 was spent on replacing the glass walls and the metal supports, as well as the plants that had been destroyed. Although unfortunately, the collection of tropical palm trees has proved too expensive to replace up to now. At present, the glasshouses are open from 10am to 3pm Mondays to Thursdays, and it's hoped to extend this to the weekend soon. We're grateful to all those who helped us by contributing their time and money to this achievement.",245.9708125,134.89405374062423,Ideal

short-stories-0267-270-hawaii.wav,"Hawaii. In the middle of the Pacific Ocean, far from any land, there are the Hawaiian islands. These islands are the tops of a chain of volcanic mountains. Two volcanoes on the island of Hawaii are still active. There are five larger islands. Hawaii is to the west. Oahu, Molo Kai, and Maui are in the middle, and Hawaii is to the east. There are three smaller islands. Hawaii is the largest island of the group, but Oahu has the largest population. The capital city Honolulu is on Oahu. Since the Hawaiian islands are so far from any land, one might wonder how people arrived there. The answer is that the first Hawaiians were very good sailors. They traveled thousands of miles from other islands in the Pacific in Canoos. To keep these canoos stable in the ocean, they attached an out trigger or pontoon to the main canoe. Sometimes they fastened two canoos together and put a wooden platform on top. Then they could carry lots of people and supplies. The first Hawaiians were Polynesians and probably came from the Marquesas and Tahiti in the South Pacific. They were a tall, good-looking people. Their kings made rules about how their people should live and priests and advisors called Kahuna's enforced these. Today the phrase, the big Kahuna, means someone who is or thinks he is very important. Although Hawai'i lies within the tropics, it has a very mild climate. Sea breezes keep the weather from getting too hot, even in the summer. Many edible plants grow in abundance there, so it was not difficult for the Hawaiians to live very comfortably without working hard. Captain Cook was the first European to reach Hawai'i in 1778. Soon European and American ships visited there regularly. The sailors also brought diseases, formerly unknown. By 1853, the population had dropped to 73,000 from about 300,000 when Cook visited in 1778. Besides Europeans, people from China, Japan, and the Philippines came to live there. Soon large plantations of sugar cane and pineapples developed. As more and more land came under Western control, the native monarchy was undermined. American plantation owners were able to arrange for United States control of the islands. Today the largest industry is tourism. Since the climate is good all year round, visitors can come at any time. When you arrive, a young Hawaiian woman will greet you. She will put a beautiful flower necklace called a lay around your neck. Hula dancers entertain tourists. Hula dancers wear skirts made of long leaves. Each dancer tells a story by moving their arms and hands in a certain way. For meals, the Hawaiians like to dig a pit in the ground, place wood in the pit, and then set the wood on fire. Food wrapped in leaves is then placed on the wood, and the pit is covered with leaves and mats. A feast cooked this way is called a luau. These traditions nowadays are usually performed for tourists or on special holidays. Hawaii is the 50th state of the United States, and its people enjoy all the advantages of the modern world.",197.38125,158.3737057091289,Fast

ielts-listening-0060-cam16-test-3-part-4.wav,"Good morning everyone, so today we're going to look at an important creative activity and that's hand knitting. Ancient knitted garments have been found in many different countries, showing that knitting is a global activity with a long history. When someone says the word knitting, we might well picture an elderly person, a grandmother perhaps, sitting by the fire knitting garments for themselves or other members of the family. It's a homely image, but one that may lead you to feel that knitting is an activity of the past. And indeed, during the previous decade, it was one of the skills that was predicted to vanish from everyday life. But although humans have sewn and knitted their own clothing for a very long time, many of these craft-based skills went into decline when industrial machines took over, mainly because they were no longer passed down from one generation to another. However, that's all changing and interest in knitting classes in many countries is actually rising, as more and more people are seeking formal instruction in the skill. With that trend, we're also seeing an increase in the sales figures for knitting equipment. So, why do people want to be taught to knit at a time when a machine can readily do the job for them? The answer is that knitting, as a handicraft, has numerous benefits for those doing it. Let's consider what some of these might be. While many people knitted garments in the past because they couldn't afford to buy clothes, it's still true today that knitting can be helpful if you're experiencing economic hardship. If you have several children who all need warm winter clothes, knitting may save you a lot of money, and the results of knitting your own clothes can be very rewarding, even though the skills you need to get going are really quite basic, and the financial outlay is minimal. But the more significant benefits in today's world are to do with well-being. In a world where it's estimated that we spend up to nine hours a day online doing something with our hands that is craft-based makes us feel good. It releases us from the stress of a technological fast-paced life. Now let's look back a bit to early knitting activities. In fact, no one really knows when knitting first began, but archaeological remains have disclosed plenty of information for us to think about. One of the interesting things about knitting is that the earliest pieces of clothing that have been found suggest that most of the items produced were round rather than flat. Discoveries from the third and fourth centuries in Egypt show that things like socks and gloves that were needed to keep hands and feet warm were knitted in one piece using four or five needles. That's very different from most knitting patterns today, which only require two. What's more, the very first needles people used were hand-carved out of wood and other natural materials, like bone, whereas today's needles are largely made of steel or plastic, and make that characteristic clicking sound when someone's using them. Unconscious people knitted using yarns made from linen, hemp, cotton and wool, and these were often very rough on the skin. The spinning wheel, which allowed people to make finer yarns and produce much greater quantities of them, led to the dominance of wool in the knitting industry, often favored for its warmth. Another interesting fact about knitting is that because it was practiced in so many parts of the world, for so many purposes, regional differences in style developed. This visual identity has allowed researchers to match bits of knitted clothing that have been unearthed over time to the region from which the wearer came, or the job that he or she did. As I've mentioned, knitting offered people from poor communities a way of making extra money while doing other tasks. For many centuries it seems men, women and children took every opportunity to knit, for example, while watching over sheep, walking to market, or riding in boats. So, let's move on.",353.2629375,115.83439884632675,Ideal

I found myself listening very carefully. I heard a tap, tap, tapping noise. I wondered where it was coming from. It seemed to be coming from the window. I turned out the light so that nobody would see me and I peeked out the window carefully. I was expecting to see a robber tapping at my window. There was nobody there. It was just a tree branch swaying in the breeze and tapping at my window. I felt silly. I turned on the lights and sat back down to read my book. A few minutes later I heard some creaking noises. I listened carefully. Then I heard a clunking noise. I think it might have been the furnace. Then there was a worrying noise. My imagination began to play tricks on me. I was imagining that there were all kinds of creatures in the house. I told myself to grow up. I wouldn't let my imagination run away with me. I was glad when my parents got home. I told them about all the noises that I had heard. My parents laughed and said that all houses make noises. We're usually just so busy that we don't hear all the noises that go on.

short-stories-0147-148-christmas.wav,"Christmas. In most Western countries, Christmas is the biggest holiday of the year. People gather with their families to celebrate this day, which occurs on December 25 each year. The holiday of Christmas celebrates the birth of Jesus Christ. In the Christian religion, Jesus Christ is recognized as the Son of God. During the Christmas season, many people celebrate the events of the birth of Jesus Christ. For example, they recall the three wise men who visited Jesus Christ shortly after his birth. Also, they recall that Jesus Christ was born in a manger, a place where horses are kept, because his parents could not find a place to stay. In Western countries, Christmas is also celebrated by many people who are not religious. People view Christmas as a time for being together with one's relatives. Children, parents, and grandparents gather to exchange presents and to eat special foods. The tradition of giving gifts at Christmas is unusual in one way. When children go to bed on the evening before Christmas, they hang large socks called stockings in their house. When they wake up on Christmas morning, the stockings have been filled with toys and candy. According to tradition, the presence has been given by a fat man who wears a white beard and a red suit. This man, called Santa Claus, flies around the world in a sled that is pulled by reindeer. He stops at each house and flies down the chimney to deliver his presence. In the weeks before Christmas, children are usually very well behaved. Their parents tell them that Santa Claus will only give presents to children who are good. Another Christmas tradition is the Christmas tree. People put a small tree inside their house and decorated with various pretty objects. Nowadays most people use an artificial tree instead of a real tree. The tradition of the Christmas tree is actually older than Christmas itself. The people of Europe celebrated the beginning of the winter season in this way, even before Christianity reached Europe. Christmas is certainly one of the most important and most enjoyed holidays in Western countries.",155.14125,136.9074955886974,Ideal

short-stories-0280-284-alexander-graham-bell.wav,"Alexander Graham Bell The Victorian period was a time of many new inventions. Earlier discoveries such as this team engine, the screw propeller, the power of electricity, and the possibility of sending messages along a wire were now applied to everyday life. Inventors such as Thomas Edison and Nicholas Tesla explored new methods for harnessing electric power. Some of the greatest discoveries were made by Alexander Graham Bell. Always born in Scotland in 1847, both as father and grandmother taught speech methods and worked with deaf and dumb children. Alexander was also interested in this work, especially as his mother was almost deaf. Alexander's two brothers died of tuberculosis, and he himself contracted the disease, so his parents decided to leave Scotland for a drier, healthier climate. They moved to Bradford, Ontario, Canada and lived in a roomy, comfortable house overlooking the Grand River. Today the Bell Homestead is an historic home museum that attracts visitors from all over the world. At that time, Canada did not have a lot of business opportunities, so Alexander found a job teaching speech in Boston, USA, but he returned to Bradford every summer. In Boston, Bell married one of his deaf students. His father-in-law suggested that there were good business opportunities in inventing communication devices. Bell soon developed a method for sending more than one telegraph message at the same time, while working on improving the telegraph, Bell and his assistant Thomas Watson found a way to send the human voice over wires. On August 10, 1876, Bell sent the first telephone message over wires strung between Bradford and Paris, Ontario, eight miles away. The telephone caused an international sensation, with government leaders asking to have one, but Bell didn't stop there. He worked on the recording properties of wax cylinders and other approaches to flat phonograph records. He also developed the photo phone, which later led to the development of the motion picture soundtrack. Bell worked on these inventions at his laboratory in Washington, D.C., but he didn't like the hot humid summer weather there, so Bell began looking for a new place to spend his summers. He decided to build a summer home in Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, the island reminded Bell of his native Scotland. Now he had space during the summer to do experiments outside. He soon began to experiment with flying machines. Bell designed and tested huge kites, hoping to come up with a frame for a flying machine. Along with some enthusiastic friends, Bell also experimented with airplanes. On February 23, 1909, one of these planes flew through the air for a half a mile. This was the first airplane flight in the British Empire. Alexander Graham Bell Museum and Pattec Nova Scotia displays many of these inventions. Bell was also interested in making a faster boat. Since much of a boat stays under water, the water resistance slows the boat down. Bell thought that if you could raise the boat out of the water, it would go much faster. Working on Cape Breton Island, Bell and his friends developed the hydrofoil, a boat that would skin the surface of the water at high speeds. Hydrofoils are in use in many places today. Every time people use the telephone, listen to a recording, watch a movie or television, or ride on a hydrofoil, they owe a debt to that great inventor, Alexander Graham Bell.",197.8253125,172.27320189371622,Fast

They are type of partnership intelligence that's being framed on huge amounts of text. We are talking about books, websites, articles, all kinds of writing. What can these LLMS do? Well, they are pretty amazing. They can write text that sounds just like a human audit. They can answer all sorts of questions on many topics and they can even transfer between different languages. You might have heard of some LLMS already. The SGPD which was made by a company called OpenAI. The plot which was created by Ampropic. Google has what called Gemini and Facebook parent company Meta has one name, Lama. This LLMS are changing the baby product with computers and how they handle information. They are making it possible for machines to understand and use language in ways that are getting closer to how humans do it. Next slide please.

We feel it tons and tons of text more than any human could read every. The computer uses something called neural networks which are kind of like a digital version of our brain work. The key trick that makes LLMS so good is called the Franco architecture. It's a clever way to help the computer understand the meaning behind words and how they relate to each other. So how does an LLMS actually work? Well, it tries to get guess what word should come next based on the words that came before. It is like a super advanced version of finishing someone's sentence. Lastly, we have a fine unit. This is when we take an LLMS that's already learned a lot of things and even more about specific topics for task. It's like training a doctor to be a hard specialist after they have learned general literacy. All of this together is what makes LLMS able to understand and generate human life text so good. Next slide please. Let's talk about how large language models or LLMS are change in teach. LLMS are really good at language tasks. They can translate between languages better than ever before. They can also take long pieces of writing and make short summaries. Second, LLMS can create content. They can write articles, help with computer coding and even write stories. This is changing how we do many jobs. Third, LLMS power smart shareboards. They can talk to people almost like a human would. They are useful for things like customer service. But we need to be careful. LLMS can sometimes show versus or spread false information like hallucinations. They also bring up questions about it. Like how they might change upso effort privacy.

ielts-listening-0308-ielts-recent-actual-test-29-part-4.wav,"We've been talking about choosing building materials in the last week. Now, a great many factors influence the choice of building materials. You can't make a house of cards, right? And people who live in glass houses and all that. Anyhow, today I'd like to say a few words about flooring. Some artificial materials can be used, like plastic for instance, which often mixed blessings when used as a flooring surface. On the one hand, plastic is cheaper than nearly any other alternative, short of bare ground. Plastic also does not warp like wood. On the other hand, the best that can be said about plastic is that it looks like wood or stone. However, it cannot replace the real materials. As I have mentioned, I'm fixing up a new house. The decorator my wife hired told me plastic does a great job of looking exactly like plastic. Besides, it scratches easily, fades or discolors and starts cracking within a year or two. So if you're fitting out a sleazy hotel or plan to live in a trailer park, go with the plastic. Really though, for all intents and purposes, this leaves us with wood or stone as choices for flooring. Stone and wood are alike in at least one respect. Both go through processing before they can be put to use. Since few of us cut our own lumber or quarry our own stone, this is not perhaps a pressing concern. Still, do it yourself as wood do well to remember to buy only properly seasoned wood. Unseasoned wood warps and a warped floor quickly becomes firewood and its owner quickly becomes purer. Likewise, except for dull, huge materials like slate or sandstone, most stone floors are polished before installation. The choice goes well beyond just wood or stone. Each type requires many further considerations. A few special remarks are called for when considering wood, for example. As always, aesthetics, personal taste and layout all play roles as well as the type of house or room. Oh, and certainly don't forget the cost. When it comes to cost, a rule of thumb is that the softer and less exotic the wood, the lower the cost. In the US, for instance, pine is both ubiquitous and cheap. Mahogany is imported and exorbitantly expensive. If you're in any kind of budget when remodeling, it's really helpful to remember to go for the softer woods. Aside from cost, there are still lots of different factors that are important in choosing the best flooring for the job. Continuing with the example of wood, one must consider the effects of each type of wood on the mood of the room. When selecting the best wood to use, particular attention needs to be paid to its grain patterns, texture and colour. In rooms where relaxation or deep thought is the aim, say bedrooms or the study, dark, strong-grained woods are the rule. Here, the grain ought to match the furniture for a feeling of homogeneity. In rooms where activity and motion are typical, the dining room or living room, lighter, finer-grained lumber is more suitable. In such a setting, the wood grain might be useful in offering a contrast to the furniture. This leads to a feel of subconscious excitement in keeping with the room's function. In either case, though, consult a decorator. It is a decorator's job to know what materials to use to fit the function of the room. Though some things about putting together a room are subjective and based on one's individual taste, materials appropriate to a room's function are much more straightforward. A decorator takes the needs of the customer and uses a mathematical formula rather than subjective words. Since feelings vary from person to person, verbal descriptions of wood types tend to be ambiguous. You want the wood, you select, not something approximate. And if you do decide to do it yourself, remember that all wood must be treated with preservatives to enhance its appearance and preserve its natural beauty. In the case of stone or quarry tile as flat cut flooring stone is properly called, a new set of considerations must be weighed up. Simple, colour aside, the degree of reflection must be kept in mind. This is called the reflectance rate, which is expressed in a number between 0.0 and 1.0, depending on the amount of light it reflects. At one end of the scale is polished silver. At a rating of 1.0, this shiny surface reflects nearly all of the light directed at it. Numbers closer to 0 describe materials that absorb more light. Moving down the scale a bit, we see the plastic that has been painted white has a rate of 0.8, which makes sense. We know that the colour white reflects all other colour, while black absorbs all colour and plastic itself is a relatively reflective material. Materials that are denser and darker have reflectance rates much closer to 0. The quarry tile I mentioned a while ago has a rate of 0.1. As you may know, quarry tile is generally dark brown and made from clay, so it is quite dense. Of course, there is considerable variation among types of quarry tile because of the hue or treatment of the clay during its creation. Does anyone have any guesses as to what material may have a rate of almost 0.0? We can guess most of these materials are black in colour, but plastic would and even stone reflect some light. One material with a rate of almost 0.0 is black velvet, the text to produce is almost no shine at all. Carrera marble, despite its white hue, is actually lower in reflectivity than black onyx. In any case, the fact that tiles vary somewhat should not be forgotten. A highly reflective floor would not be suitable in a library, it would be indispensable in a ballroom should your home be large enough to feature one. Again, a rule of thumb is that light means lively. Since form and material follow function, one should only use the more reflective materials in rooms where the cultivation and acceleration are. The cultivation and expression of energy is important. Bear in mind too, that most types of stone cost more than all but the rarest of wood. Of course, there is no reason why some rooms of a house should not feature wood floors or other stone tiles. You can even mix the two. A room with wood panels on the walls can have a beautiful stone floor. My bedroom has white birch walls and a light blue slate floor. The place looks like a Russian hunting lodge. Remember though, go with what feels right for you. Good taste and the laws of interior design are the homeowner's servants, not his master. It's only beautiful when you decide it is. I mean, you're the one who lives there, not the decorator, right? Okay, are there any questions?",408.528375,170.5144716080003,Fast

short-stories-0266-269-gilbert-and-sullivan.wav,"Gilbert and Sullivan. Gilbert and Sullivan are the authors of many lively and humorous operettas. These works are the most popular of their kind and are regularly performed today. But the two authors are known, almost as well for their arguments and disagreements. The famous partners were very different people, with very different interests. William S. Gilbert wrote the words that Sullivan set to music. Gilbert had a special talent for humorous verse. He loved puns and had a very quick wit. Personally though, he was very business-like. He had wanted to enter the military and always had the look of a soldier about him. He was fond of giving orders and disliked criticism of anything he did. Arthur S. Sullivan, on the other hand, was a sensitive emotional person whose main interest was music. Sullivan came from a poor family, but his musical talent and good looks had helped him to succeed. Sullivan wanted to write serious classical music, but as a poor man, he needed a source of income. Sullivan also needed someone to direct him. On his own, he had trouble deciding what to do. Gilbert and Sullivan never became really good friends, and at the end of their lives, they had little contact with each other. But the writer and musician needed each other. Gilbert needed a composer who could enliven his writings for the stage. Sullivan needed someone to write a text for his music. Sullivan, who tended to be lazy, needed someone to push him. A theatrical manager named Richard Doiley Cart arranged their first collaboration. Gilbert visited Sullivan and read him a satire on the legal system, Trial By Jury. Sullivan loved the piece and quickly wrote the music. Trial By Jury was produced in 1875 and became the first triumph for the partners. Doiley Cart decided to form an acting company, which would stage future works by Gilbert and Sullivan. A string of successes follows. The Sorcerer in 1877. HMS Pinafore in May 1878. The Pirates of Penzance in December 1878. Patients in 1881. Iolandth in 1882. The Macado in 1885. The Yoman of the Guard in 1888. And the Gondoliers in 1889. In spite of these successes, the two partners were not happy. Sullivan did not like the way Gilbert dominated their relationship. Sullivan had to write music for Gilbert's scripts. Why couldn't Gilbert write words for Sullivan's music? Gilbert, on the other hand, thought that Sullivan got the most of the credit for the success of their operettas and that he was overlooked. Gilbert was a driving force in the relationship. He was always writing new scripts and taking them to Sullivan. It was Gilbert who rehearsed the actors and supervised the productions. Sullivan had little to do with the actual performance. He usually did conduct the orchestra on opening night. The amazing thing is how these two different people produced such wonderful work. Each separately had difficulty writing something that the public wanted. Together, they were unbeatable. Gilbert's sharpened, often cutting remarks were made acceptable by Sullivan's beautiful music. Gilbert's satire might have made people angry, but Sullivan's music calmed them down. Even when the English people were the targets of Gilbert's criticisms, the audience went out of the theater humming these criticisms to Sullivan's music.",212.715125,154.2908620155713,Fast

Lake Superior, the largest lake at 82,100 square kilometers, is also the largest freshwater lake in the world. Its outlet is the St. Mary's River, which enters Lake Huron after falling about seven meters over a series of rapids. Lake Huron and Lake Michigan lie at the same elevation. Water flows from Lake Michigan to Lake Huron. Lake Michigan is deeper than Lake Huron, but the latter is larger in area at 59,600 square kilometers. Lake Huron drains into the St. Clair River, which falls about three meters between Lake Huron and the small shallow basin of Lake St. Clair.

ielts-listening-0110-cam13-test-4-part-2.wav,"Hi everyone, welcome to the snow centre. My name is Annie. I hope you enjoyed the bus trip from the airport. We've certainly got plenty of snow today. Well, you've come to New Zealand's premier snow and ski centre, and we've a whole load of activities for you during your week here. Most visitors come here for the cross-country skiing, where you're on fairly flat ground for most of the time, rather than going down steep mountain sides. There are marked trails, but you can also leave these and go off on your own, and that's an experience not to be missed. You can go at your own speed. It's great aerobic exercise if you really push yourself, or if you prefer, you can just glide gently along and enjoy the beautiful scenery. This afternoon, you'll be going on a dog sled trip. You may have seen our dogs on TV recently racing in the Winter Sleed Festival. If you want, you can have your own team for the afternoon, and learn how to drive them, following behind our leader on the trail. Or if you'd prefer, you can just sit back in the sled and enjoy the ride as a passenger. At the weekend, we have the team relay event, and you're all welcome to join in. We have a local school coming along, and a lot of the teachers are taking part too. Participation rather than winning is the main focus, and there's a medal for everyone who takes part. Participants are in teams of two to four, and each team must complete four laps of the course. For your final expedition, you'll head off to Mount Frenner, wearing a pair of special snow shoes, which allow you to walk on top of the snow. This is an area where mine is once searched for gold, though there are very few traces of their work left now. When the snow melts in summer, the mountain slopes are carpeted in flowers and plants. It's a long ascent, though not too steep, and walkers generally take a couple of days to get to the summit and return. You'll spend the night in our hut halfway up the mountain. That's included in your package for this day. It's got cooking facilities, firewood and water for drinking. For washing, we recommend you use melted snow, though, to conserve supplies. We can take your luggage up on our snowmobile for you for just $10 a person. The hut has cooking facilities, so you can make a hot meal in the evening and morning, but you need to take your own food. The weather on Mount Frenner can be very stormy. In that case, stay in the hut. Generally, the storms don't last long. Don't stress about getting back here to the centre in time to catch the airport bus. They'll probably not be running anyway. We do have an emergency locator beacon in the hut, but only use that if it's a real emergency, like if someone's ill or injured. Now, let me tell you something about the different ski trails you can follow during your stay here. Highland trails directly accessible from where we are now. This trail's been designed to give first timers an experience they'll enjoy regardless of their age or skill, but it's also ideal for experts to practice their technique. Then there's Pine Trail. If you're nervous about skiing, leave this one to the experts. You follow a steep valley looking right down on the river below. Scary, but if you fully master the techniques needed for hills, it's great fun. Stoney Trail's a good choice once you've got a general idea of the basics. There are one or two tricky sections, but nothing too challenging. There's a shelter halfway where you can sit and take a break and enjoy the afternoon sunshine. And finally, Loser's Trail. This starts off following a gentle river valley, but the last part is quite exposed, so the snow conditions can be challenging. If it's snowing or windy, check with us before you set out to make sure the trails open that day. Right, so now if you'd like to follow me, we'll get started.",254.8643125,165.49982846264518,Fast

short-stories-0145-146-learning-to-drive.wav,"Learning to drive. Each year many young people learn to drive a car. For many people, learning to drive is important because the car is an important method of transportation in many places. Before learning to drive a car, it is important to understand the rules of the road. A beginning driver should already understand the many signs that are found along the roads. Also, the student driver should know the many rules about changing lanes, turning, stopping, and many other aspects of driving. In addition, the driver should be familiar with the way the car is operated. It is important to know how to use the lights, signals, brakes, accelerator, and steering wheel. When a person starts learning to drive, it may take some time to become skillful. It takes some practice to become an expert in driving a car. One must become familiar with steering, speeding up and slowing down. At first, it is good to practice driving in a large open space, such as an empty parking lot. Here, one can practice without being a danger to anyone. When a person gains some skill in driving, it is then safe enough to practice driving on a road. Of course, a student driver must still be very careful. He or she should always have an expert driver in the car with him or her. Many beginning drivers take driving lessons from professional instructors who can teach safe driving techniques. Eventually, the young driver is ready for a driving test, which is needed to obtain a regular driver's license. This test is supervised by a government official. In the driving test, the driver must show that he or she can control the car with great skill by being able to make turns and to park the car in small spaces. But he or she must also show respect for the rules of the road by driving at a proper speed and obeying all traffic signs and signals. Of course, even when one has obtained a driver's license, it is always important to drive carefully and responsibly.",141.9233125,146.69894348752604,Ideal

ielts-listening-0316-ielts-recent-actual-test-31-part-4.wav,"Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome you to our exhibition, Two Centuries of the Bike. Let's stroll around the exhibition, shall we? Although there were a few early efforts back in the 1700s, you didn't really see many bikes till, say, the 1830s in England. Bikes were a response to the rapid growth of cities early in the 19th century. Cities like London were getting too big to walk across. The early bike let people travel with less effort than walking. Plus, a bike was a lot cheaper than a horse. Think of it. No one invited a bike for, what, 5,000 years of human history. Why did people do it then? Probably because this was the start of the machine age. People wanted machines to do all the work. They were some drawbacks, however. For one thing, there were no pedals. You simply pushed yourself along using your feet, kind of like today's skateboard. When you were a man, you went fairly slow. And uphill you actually worked harder, pushing that too wheeler. Plus the wheels were made of wood, covered with metal, as you can see from this model. So the downside was that the ride was quite uncomfortable on most roads. Only if you gadget lovers how to use them. By the 1860s, though, improvements were being made. As you can see from this specimen, metal frames had become the rule. They are more durable than wood, and they didn't warp in the rain. The biggest improvement, however, was the development of the chain and sprocket system. They're connected. This meant you did not push the bike. You used pedals just like today. You had to try harder to balance, so it took some practice to figure out how to use the pedals. But it made the ride so much easier. As a result, the good thing was that you could ride a lot more smoothly and with very little effort. By the 1880s, another big change was the use of rubber wheels. These became pretty common at that time. Though the first ones were solid rubber, the ride was a good deal more comfortable than the old iron and wood system. This is a big consideration because the faster you go, the more you feel every bump. Air-filled tires, pneumatic tires, didn't really come into use until around the year 1900, as you can see from this exhibition over here. That made the ride even more comfortable. So by 1890 or so, people were going a lot faster and a lot more smoothly. There was one problem when you were going quickly and comfortably, oh no, how do I stop? Yes, we all laughed now, but for a long time, the only way to stop was to drag your feet. That didn't work very well and it would be dangerous if you were going fast. In the crowded cities of those years, New York, Chicago and so on, you would get killed if you couldn't stop for, say, a street car. Plus, look at this bike. The front wheel is nearly a meter and two-thirds tall. They made them that way so you could see over people and wagons, but you couldn't drag your feet. This model is called a Velocipede, a speed pedal. Another characteristic of the bike in this period is that it has two equal sized wheels, which signaled a big change in bikes. For with the Velocipede, brakes appeared. If you wanted to stop, you just pushed the pedal backwards. Doing that stopped the back wheel of the bike. This technique worked a lot better than dragging your feet or jumping off the high seat there. This meant the bikes became a great deal safer. It would have been safer if people wore helmets, but the first bicycle helmet wasn't invented until years later, and even then, it was little more than a leather ball cap. It really wasn't until the 1970s that the bike helmet was modified to provide some real protection. Before continuing on to look at development since the 1890s, let's say a word more about safety. Everyone knows if you're going downhill, you can get going dangerously fast. To go more than 100 kilometers an hour isn't all that difficult, but even on level ground, it's easy to go too quickly. On a city street, today's bicycles can be ridden at a speed of over 40 miles an hour over a short distance. It's about 64 kilometers an hour. Remember, you're on a bike not in a car. There's nothing to protect you. People are killed in single bicycle accidents every day, just from hitting the road. A good rule to remember is if you're going faster than the cars, slow down, and please wear a helmet. Nearly one quarter of the epilepsy cases come from head injuries in accidents on bikes and motorcycles. I don't mean to scare you, but safety is everyone's business. What? Now that's a good question. Why are today's bikes so much faster? Well, it's not just that today's athletes are faster. The answer is partly mechanical. If you look closely here at the back wheel, you'll see a number of gears. Changing gears is what makes those fast speeds possible. You can shift gears depending on the terrain and how hard you wish to pedal. So you can put it on a higher gear for downhill and the lower gear for uphill travel to make it easier to climb that slope. You'll notice this gear shifting mechanism is attached to the back wheel. And when the rider shifts on the handlebar gear shifter, the chain moves to the appropriate sprocket. And speaking of changing gears, let's look over here at our Tour de France exhibit.",330.4895,176.10241777726677,Fast
short-stories-0270-273-las-vegas-nevada.wav,"Las Vegas, Nevada. Nevada is a large state of deserts and mountains. Since most of the land is not suitable for farming, the population grew very slowly. In the 1950s, there were only 267,000 people in the entire state. Now, there are nearly a million people living in the Las Vegas area alone. Las Vegas has become a major tourist center. It used to be quite a little desert town of the Old West, but in the 1950s and 1960s, hotels and gambling casinos were opened. In order to bring tourists to town, these hotels hired well-known entertainers. Soon, Las Vegas became known as a major entertainment center. In order to promote the growth of Nevada, some activities were allowed, which were against the law in other states. These included gambling and prostitution. It was also easier to get married in Nevada than in some other states. Over time, many other attractions were developed. Much of the activity in Las Vegas goes on at some 30 major hotels. Many of these hotels provide a complete range of services and entertainment. Some of them boast 4,000 or 5,000 rooms. It is common for these large hotels to be organized around a particular theme, such as the Middle Ages, the Arabian Knights, the movies, the circus, Paris Egypt or the Far East. The hotel, its restaurants, shops, lounges and entertainment reflect this theme. For example, the Paris Las Vegas Hotel has a 50-story replica of the Eiffel Tower. The Luxor Hotel has a huge image of an Egyptian's finks and a replica of the tomb of King Todd. Nearly all of the major hotels also contain a casino, sometimes several casinos. Gambling is a major reason why people come to Las Vegas. There are slot machines, blackjack tables and roulette wheels and much more. Even though Las Vegas is in the desert, there is an extravagant use of water. Large swimming pools, water slides, artificial waterfalls and huge fountains are common. Health spas, beauty salons, fashion boutiques, specialty restaurants and malls abound. Tennis and golf are also popular. The lavish shows at Las Vegas are world famous, tall dancing showgirls like the famous rockets where beautiful but rather skimpy costumes. Some entertainers like singer Wayne Newton rarely leave Las Vegas. The pay there is good and the audiences are appreciative. Near Las Vegas are other tourist sites such as the Giant Hoover Dam. Behind the Hoover Dam is the large artificial lake, Lake Mead. Further up the river is the Grand Canyon. All these things are a short trip from the city. Las Vegas is called the city that never sleeps. At nearly any time of the day or night, there are casinos and shows that are open. A monorail connects many of the leading hotels. Many people view Las Vegas as a total entertainment package. One word of caution. Set yourself a limit on how much you will spend at the casinos.

short-stories-0236-238-the-ford-pinto-case.wav,"The Ford Pinto Case Businessmen often complain that their profits are negatively affected by government regulations. On the other hand, history has proven that it is necessary to regulate business in at least one area, public safety. There is ample evidence that consideration for the safety of the public is not always a priority in business decisions. Back in 1912, the Titanic smashed into an iceberg, killing hundreds of people. It was going too fast through a large collection of icebergs while attempting to set a speed record. Unfortunately, there were not enough lifeboats to accommodate the passengers. Usually when such a tragedy occurs, the company is not found guilty. Instead, safety regulations are enacted for future cases. In the future, ships were ordered to carry a sufficient supply of lifeboats. In 1978, the Ford Motor Company was indicted on the charge of homicide. This was the first time such a charge had been brought against an American corporation. It related to the deaths of three teenage girls who were burned up when their Ford Pinto was hit from behind. The prosecution charged that the Ford Company knowingly manufactured a dangerous car. During this story is the pressure on Ford to produce a small car to compete with imported vehicles. The Pinto was rushed into production in spite of warnings that the gas tank was in a dangerous position. Would have cost Ford an additional $11 per car to fix the problem. Ford decided not to. Later, Ford produced a cost-benefit analysis to justify their position, estimating that the faulty design would cause 180 additional deaths, Ford valued these at $200,000 per person. This cost was far less than equipping $12.5 million vehicles with $11 protectors, so Ford felt that they had made the right decision. For the executives were acquitted on the charge of homicide. Nonetheless, Ford had to pay out millions of dollars in out-of-court settlements. These were paid to families who had lost relatives in Pinto accidents. This case shows how far a company will go to protect its profits. For more than eight years, Ford lobbied the government not to tighten safety standards on cars. As long as the Pinto was profitable, Ford did not want to change the design. Although Ford made a lot of money on the Pinto, their reputation was tarnished. The Ford Pinto case is one of many which point to the need for governments to set safety standards. No business wants to recall its products or leave them sitting idly in a warehouse or expand large sums of money for upgrading and repairs. No airplane company wants to have its planes in the hanger when they could be in the air making money for the corporation. As a result, commercial companies are seldom motivated to look closely at product or service safety. This is especially true today when the bottom line in business is seen as a justification for every decision. For this reason, governments have to oversee issues of public safety. Most businesses are too busy working on profits to have much time or concern for doing so.",200.986125,154.63754027796696,Fast

This river holds a special place in American history and literature, and in the imagination of ordinary Americans. The Mississippi River begins in the hills of northern Minnesota near the Canadian border, and flows southward about 3,700 kilometers through ten states before draining its water and silt into the Gulf of Mexico. Traditionally, the river is viewed as a natural boundary between the eastern and western halves of the United States. Until the year 1803, the areas to the west of the Mississippi River and the areas around the mouth of the river were claimed by Spain and by France. In that year, the French emperor Napoleon decided to sell this land to the United States of America. This sale, which is called the Louisiana Purchase, was very important for the United States. By controlling the Mississippi River, the Americans would be able to use it for transporting goods and people in this rapidly developing area. For many years, river boats were the main method of long-distance transportation for people living near the Mississippi. Steam-powered boats with large paddle wheels that pushed the boat forward were very popular in the time before cars and airplanes. One of the famous cities along the Mississippi River is St. Louis. This city is known as the Gateway to the West. During the 19th century, St. Louis was the last large town that people would pass through on their way to a new farmland farther west. Today, St. Louis is famous for the Gateway Arch, a tall monument that welcomes people to the west. St. Louis is also known as the city where the music known as the Blues began. Near the mouth of the Mississippi River is another famous city, New Orleans. In terms of the styles of buildings, New Orleans is said to be the most unusual American city because it is influenced so strongly by Spanish and French traditions. And today, the traditional festival of Mardi Gras is celebrated in New Orleans each year. New Orleans and the surrounding areas of the state of Louisiana are famous for spicy Cajun food. This style of cooking was developed by the French-speaking settlers of Louisiana. The Mississippi River is famous in many stories of American literature. For example, the Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, which were written by the author Mark Twain, are both set along the Mississippi River. Today, the federal and state governments of the United States are working to preserve the natural environment along the Mississippi River. People recognize the importance of keeping this river healthy and clean.",188.0294375,144.23273483440593,Ideal

What's wrong with Asian honeybees? Are they so different from Australian bees? Well, in fact, they look almost the same, but they are infested with mites, microscopic creatures which live on them, and which can seriously damage our own homegrown bees, or could even wipe them out. Well, what would happen if Australian bees died out? Well, the honey from Australian bees is of excellent quality, much better than the stuff the Asian bees produce.

ielts-listening-0232-cam5-test-2-part-4.wav,"Tonight I'm going to talk to you about that remarkable continent Antarctica. Remote, hostile, and at present uninhabited on a permanent basis. For early explorers, it was the ultimate survival contest. For researchers like me, it remains a place of great intellectual challenge. While for the modern tourist, it's simply a wilderness of great beauty. First, some facts and figures. Antarctica is a place of extremes. The highest, coldest, and windiest continent, and over 58 times the size of the UK. The ice cap contains almost 70% of the world's fresh water, and 90% of its ice. But with very low snowfall, most of the continent technically falls unbelievably into the category of desert. Each icebergs break off the continent each year. While in winter half the surrounding ocean freezes over, which means its size almost doubles. Research and exploration has been going on in Antarctica for more than 200 years, and has involved scientists from many different countries who work together on research stations. Here, science and technical support have been integrated in a very cost-effective way. Our Antarctic Research Program has several summer's only stations and two all-year round ones. I was based on one of the all-year round ones. The research stations are really self-contained communities of about 20 people. There's living and working space, a kitchen with a huge food store, a small hospital, and a well-equipped gym to ensure everyone keeps fit in their spare time. The station generates its own electricity and communicates with the outside world using a satellite link. Our station, 0-1, had some special features. It wasn't built on land, but on an ice shelf, hundreds of meters thick. Supplies were brought to us on large slages from a ship 15 kilometers away at the ice edge. Living in the Antarctic hasn't always been so comfortable. Snow build-ups caused enormous problems for four previous stations on the same site, which were buried and finally crushed by the weight. Fortunately, no one was hurt, but these buildings became a huge challenge to architects, who finally came up with a remarkable solution. The buildings are placed on platforms, which can be raised above the changing snow level on legs which are extendable. Food is one of the most important aspects of survival in a polar climate. People living there need to obtain a lot more energy from their food, both to keep warm and to undertake heavy physical work. Maybe you know that an adult in the UK will probably need about 1700 kilocalories a day on average. Someone in Antarctica will need about 3,500 just over double. This energy is provided by foods which are high in carbohydrate and fat. Americans for field work present an additional problem. They need to provide maximum energy, but they must also be compact and light for easy transport. Special boxes are prepared, each containing enough food for one person for 20 days. You may be familiar with coffee processed by freeze drying, which preserves the quality of the food product while making a large saving in weight. Well, this type of presentation is ideal in our situation. It wasn't available to earlier polar explorers whose diet was commonly insufficient for their health. I think that being at the cutting edge of science has a special appeal for everyone working in Antarctica in whatever capacity. As a marine biologist, my own research was fascinating, but it's perhaps climate change research that is the most crucial field of study. Within this general field, surveying changes in the volume and stability of the ice cap is vital, since these may have profound effects on world sea levels and on ocean currents. A second important area is monitoring the size of the hole in the ozone layer above Antarctica, since this is an indicator of global ultraviolet radiation levels. Thirdly, bubbles in the ice sheet itself provide an index of pollution, because frozen inside them are samples of previous atmospheres over the past 500,000 years, and these provide us with evidence for the effects of such human activities as agriculture and industry. There are an increasing number of opportunities for young people to work for a period in Antarctica, not only as research assistants in projects like mine, but also in a wide range of junior administrative and technical positions, including vacancies for matmakers. I hope that the insights I've provided will encourage you to take up these opportunities in this fascinating continent.",352.131875,126.77068782824617,Ideal

ielts-listening-0042-cam17-test-3-part-2.wav,"Good afternoon. My name is Mrs Carter and I run the before and after school extended hours child care service. I hope you've had a chance to have a good look around the school and talk to staff and pupils. I know that many of you are interested in using our child care service when your child joins the school. And perhaps you already know something about it. But for those that don't, I'll go through the main details now. We offer child care for children from the ages of 4 to 11, both before and after school. I know that many parents who work find this service invaluable. You can leave your child with us safe in the knowledge that they will be extremely well cared for. We are ensured to provide care for up to 70 children, although we rarely have this many attending at any one session. I think we generally expect around 50 to 60 children for the afternoon sessions and about half that number for the breakfast sessions. Although we currently do have 70 children registered with us, not all of these attend every day. It's 10 years since we began offering an extended hours service and we've come a long way during that time. When we first opened, we only had about 20 children attending regularly. We try to keep our costs as low as we can and we think we provide very good value for money. For the afternoon sessions which run from 3.30 until 6pm, it's £7.20. But if you prefer, you can pay for one hour only which costs £3.50 or two hours which costs £5.70. The cost of the child care includes food and snacks. They'll be given breakfast in the morning and in the afternoon a healthy snack as soon as they finish school. At 5pm children are given something more substantial such as pasta or a casserole. Please inform us of any allergies that your child might have and will make sure they're offered a suitable alternative. As you may know, the child care service runs through the school holidays from 8am to 6pm. We offer a really varied and exciting programme to keep the children entertained. We don't want them to feel as if they are still at school. It will also feel different because they'll get the chance to make new friends with children from other schools. Spaces are available for them because a lot of our 10 time children don't always attend during the holiday. In the past, parents have asked if children over the age of 11 are allowed to come with their younger brothers and sisters, but I'm afraid we're unable to do this because of the type of insurance we have. So now let me tell you about some of the activities that your child can do during the after school sessions. As well as being able to use the playground equipment, computers and the library, there is usually at least one special activity that children can do each day. For example, Spanish. We have a specialist teacher coming in every Thursday to give a basic introduction to the language through games and songs. She does two sessions, one for the overates and one for the younger children. This is the only activity which we have to make an extra charge for, but it's well worth it. Once a week the children have the opportunity to do some music, we're very lucky that one of our staff is a member of a folk band. On Mondays she teaches singing and percussion to groups of children. We do rely on parental support for this, so if any of you sing or play an instrument and would be prepared to help out at these sessions, we'd be delighted. Painting continues to be one of the most popular activities. To begin with, we weren't keen on offering this because of the extra mess involved, but children kept asking if they could do some art and so we finally gave in. Art is great for helping the children to relax after working hard at school all day. Yoga is something that we've been meaning to introduce for some time, but haven't been able to find anyone available to teach it until now that is. So we'll see how this goes. Hopefully children will benefit in all sorts of ways from this. Cooking is another popular activity. They make a different sort of cake or pizza or bread each week. Although the younger children love doing it, we found that the mess was just too much, so we've decided to restrict this to the overate as they are better able to clean up after themselves.",308.977625,153.02078912672076,Fast

short-stories-0256-259-anastasia-and-the-russian-revolution.wav,"Anastasia and the Russian Revolution. The 20th century brought many changes to traditional cultures around the world. Some of the most radical changes occurred in the Russian Empire, which had one of the oldest monarchies in Europe. In 1917-18, the rule of the Tsars was replaced by the world's first communist government, led by Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. No one was more affected by these changes than Anastasia, the Tsars' youngest daughter. Between 1895 and 1901, Tsar Nicholas II and his wife Alexandra became the parents of four beautiful and healthy daughters, Olga, Tatyana, Marie, and Anastasia. However, since a girl could not inherit the throne of Russia, it was important for Alexandra to give birth to a son. Finally, in 1904, the Tsar and Zarina had a son, Alexei. This event, which should have made the whole family very happy, proved to be a source of great sorrow. Alexei was soon found to have an incurable disease. This disease, hemophilia, meant that Alexei regularly suffered from uncontrollable internal and external bleeding, which left him very weak. This caused anxiety for all the family, especially his mother and father. The Tsar and Zarina loved their children. The girls, who didn't have to worry about becoming rulers, led a fairly carefree existence, and Estesia and her sisters lived in a palace with hundreds of servants. They attended many society parties with their parents. The most elaborate parties were grand balls, where everyone dressed in their finest clothes and danced all through the night. The absolute rule of the Tsar was not popular with everybody. The majority of the population was poor peasant farmers, who could barely keep themselves and their families alive. If they moved into the city to get jobs in the factories, they had to work long hours for very low wages and live in slum conditions. Popular opposition forced the Tsar in 1905 to give up some of his power to unelected parliament. None of the girls married. They all lived a happy life together. They moved from palace to palace, attended by their private tutors, visiting the beach and sailing on the royal yacht. Anastasia was the clown of the family. She didn't like schoolwork, but she enjoyed painting and photography. Many of her photos of the royal family and happy times survive. Soon the Tsar's problems worsened. The Empress, Alexandra, worried about her son and became ill. War with Germany broke out in 1914, and the Russians suffered many defeats and losses. In March 1917, there was a popular revolution, and the Tsar was deposed. From that time on, the royal family were prisoners. At first, they were treated kindly, but in November, the Bolsheviks or communists gained control of the revolution. Lenin and his followers hated the Tsar. The royal family had been living in Tabulsk in Siberia because of fears that they might escape. They were brought back to Ekaterinburg, in the Ural region. Here, after midnight, on June 19, 1918, the entire royal family was shot by the Bolsheviks. To some, this news was too dreadful to be believed. The thought that the Tsars, lively and beautiful daughters had been killed, was too hard to bear. Within a couple of years, a woman who went by the name of Anna Anderson appeared in Western Europe. She claimed to be Anastasia, some believed her story, and some did not. With the fall of the Soviet Union, it was possible to investigate the murder of the royal family. It was also possible to prove that Anna Anderson was not the real Anastasia. After a long search, the bodies of Anastasia and Alexei were found. They had died with the rest of the family. A great mystery was finally solved.",244.48,152.89594240837698,Fast

short-stories-0226-228-niagara-on-the-lake.wav,"Niagara on the Lake Niagara on the Lake is a little town at the mouth of the Niagara River. It is only 12 miles north of Niagara Falls. It used to be true that very few tourists would bother to travel from the falls down to Niagara on the Lake. Nowadays, however, the little town itself is a major tourist attraction. The town has a remarkable history. The area played an important role in both the American Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. As a result, the little town has two forts, four George and four Mississauga. When four George was reconstructed for the public in the 1930s, Niagara on the Lake got its first big tourist attraction. Because Niagara on the Lake was the first capital of Ontario, it has many significant firsts. There was the first Parliament in the province, the first legal society, the first library, the first newspaper, the first museum building, and many more firsts. Besides its history, the town which is bordered by Lake Ontario and the Niagara River has beautiful scenery. On a summer's day, visitors can watch the sailboats going out the river to the lake. On the land side, Niagara is part of the fruit belt of Ontario. Peaches, pears, apples, cherries, and strawberries grow here in abundance. There are also long rows of vines and wine making has recently become a major industry. The mild humid climate allows plants to flourish. The trees, especially the oaks, grow to remarkable heights. Flowering trees and shrubs perfume the air in the spring. Gardens are often spectacular for much of the year. Because of this, Niagara on the Lake attracts many painters and photographers. Many of the private homes also have a long history, and great care is taken to keep them looking their best. The biggest single attraction is the Shaw Festival Theater. The festival was founded in 1962 by a group of Shaw enthusiasts. Early productions were often held in the historic courthouse on the main street and plays still take place there. In 1973, however, a new 861-seat Shaw Theatre was built at the south end of town. Since then, traffic to Niagara on the Lake has been steady all through the long summer season. In 1996, Niagara on the Lake was voted the prettiest town in Canada. Partly, it is the scale of things that makes the old town so attractive. The old town is only about eight blocks long by eight blocks wide. It has a population of little more than 1,000 people. Nonetheless, there is a lot for people to do and see. There are many interesting shops, old hotels, bookstores, art galleries, museums, a golf course, a marina, historic churches and cemeteries, several parks, three theaters and lots of restaurants. Because it is small, Niagara on the Lake is a good place to walk around or bicycle around. There are also horse and wagon rides. Although the main street can be hectic in tourist season, one doesn't have to go far off the main street to get in touch with an older, slower time. Most of the downtown buildings haven't changed much since the days of Queen Victoria, and tourists can still imagine that they are back in the days before computers and television.",222.6939375,147.91601589962457,Ideal
short-stories-0158-159-visiting-the-doctor.wav,"visiting the doctor. When people feel sick, they go to a doctor. But sometimes people visit the doctor even when they are not sick. Doctors can perform a medical check-up to find out if a person is healthy. By performing this physical examination, the doctor can identify any health problems that might be developing. During a check-up, the doctor examines your eyes, ears, and throat. The doctor uses a small flashlight to examine the eyes, ears, and throat. It is important to make sure that the eyes react normally to changes in light. It is also important to make sure that the ears and throat have a normal appearance. When the doctor examines your throat, he or she will ask you to open your mouth wide and say, ah! The doctor uses a stethoscope to examine the patient's heartbeat. The stethoscope hangs around the doctor's neck. By using a stethoscope, a doctor can hear the patient's heartbeat very clearly. While checking the patient's heart, the doctor also listens carefully to make sure that the patient's breathing is normal. The doctor also checks the patient's blood pressure. Blood pressure is measured by placing a cuff around the arm. Air is then pumped into the cuff, and this allows blood pressure to be measured. Having very high blood pressure or very low blood pressure is not good for one's health. It is better to be in between. Another part of the examination is a test of the reflexes. The doctor tests the patient's reflexes by gently hitting his or her knee with a small hammer. If a person has normal reflexes, the leg will extend suddenly. Sometimes a doctor may give injections using a needle as an extra part of the check-up. These injections, called vaccinations, prevent the patient from developing certain illnesses. Medical check-ups can help to maintain health, but people should also maintain their health by leading a healthy lifestyle.",127.347,150.76915828405853,Fast

short-stories-0239-241-the-niagara-parks-commission.wav,"Niagara Parks Commission Niagara Falls Canada became a major tourist attraction in the mid-1830s. By this time, roads, canals and railways were able to bring people from urban centers like New York and Boston. However, the chance for big profits attracted dishonest businessmen, one hotel in the 1860s was popularly known as the Cave of the Forty Thieves. There were many complaints from tourists about tricks that were used to get their money. Some businessmen tried to put up fences around the falls so that all visitors would have to pay them to see the falls. In time, these complaints reached the ears of important people. In 1873, Lord Duffer and the Governor General of Canada proposed that the government buy all the land around the falls. On the American side, New York State bought 412 acres around the American Rainbow Falls in 1885. In the same year, land was bought near the Canadian Horseshoe Falls and named Queen Victoria Park. A commission was formed to obtain control of all land along the Niagara River. This was made easier because a narrow strip along the river was already government land. However, the commission wanted to preserve all the beautiful scenery along the river and near the falls for the general public. The first commissioner of the park was Sir Kazumir Gzawski, a distinguished engineer of Polish birth. Before the Queen Victoria Park commission began to buy up land besides the falls, tourists had to pay for everything. There were no public washrooms, no drinking fountains and no safety barriers around the falls. As a result, it was not uncommon for tourists crowding close to the falls or hypnotized by the flow of the river to step too close and fall in. The commission took care of these problems and also set up parks and picnic areas. In 1927, the commission's name was changed to the Niagara Parks Commission. It now supervises numerous attractions and parks from Niagara on the lake on Lake Ontario, down to Fort Erie on Lake Erie. Each section of the 56-kilometer stretch of Niagara Parks has its own places of interest. These are joined by the Niagara Parkway, a road that runs the whole length of the river. Sir Winston Churchill called the parkway the prettiest Sunday afternoon drive in the world. The Niagara Parks Commission operates restaurants, parks and gardens, rides, museums and historic houses, golf courses, native sites and gift shops. Near the falls are restaurants, parks, greenhouses, the journey behind the falls and the maid of a mist boat ride. North of the falls at Niagara Gorge are the Spanish Arrow Car Ride and a great Gorge Adventure. The commission also operates a school of horticulture with large gardens. Winston Heights is a park commemorating one of Canada's heroes, General Isaac Brock. In nearby, Queenston are historic houses connected with two other important Canadians, Laura Seacord and William Line McKenzie. The commission also operates two historic forts dating from the war of 1812, Fort Gorge and Old Fort Erie. The Niagara Parks Commission has played a major role in making Niagara Falls and the Niagara River one of the leading tourist areas in the world.

short-stories-0277-281-the-great-walls-of-china.wav,"The Great Walls of China The Great Wall of China is famous in North America, and many tourists would like to travel there. However, most North Americans don't know very much about Chinese history. That is changing now, as China is becoming an important subject for study in the West. The settled communities of China were targets for nomadic raids since earliest times. For much of its early history, China was not fully unified. However, Shi Wang, who died in 210 BC, united the whole country. Then he said about defending China from the northern nomads. It seems likely there have been defensive walls in the north before. However, Shi Wang had a wall constructed across the entire north of China. This defensive wall extended for almost 2,000 miles and had 25,000 towers. Such walls were very expensive to build. They also required huge numbers of men to construct them, and later to defend them. Even so, the Great Wall did not stop nomadic invasions altogether. Not long after Shi Wang's death, a tribe called the Huns crossed the Wall. The Emperor, Houti, who expanded Chinese power beyond the Wall, defeated them. Centuries later, the Mongols to the north of China were united under Genghis Khan. The Mongols attacked China and Kubla Khan, grandson of Genghis, became the first non-Chinese emperor of China in 1279. Eventually, the Chinese rebelled and overthrew their Mongol rulers. Nonetheless, the Mongols remained a threat. In 1449, they destroyed a Chinese army and captured the Emperor. A new Great Wall was begun to keep the Mongols out. This is the Wall which tourists visit today, and which is pictured on Chinese stamps. Construction continued for 200 years, while some parts were built off packed earth. Much of the Wall was built of stone, brick, and rubble. This is why it took so long. Stones had to be quarried and bricks baked and carried to the site. Laborers, peasants, soldiers, and criminals were forced to work on the Wall. Large and small forts and watchtowers carefully guarded the Wall. Nearly a million soldiers were stationed along it. The Chinese defenders lit fires when the enemy was sighted. Plumes of smoke and cannon shots told that the enemy was advancing and how many there were. By 1644, the new Wall was almost completed. That same year, however, an internal uprising overthrew the Emperor. This revolt was partly caused by the high taxes demanded to pay for the Wall. The Emperor is men invited the nomadic Manchu tribe to come through the gates in the Wall to help put down the revolt. The Manchu's came, but they stayed and ruled China for several hundred years. Since the Manchu's ruled both north and south of the Wall, they did not care about maintaining him. Many parts fell into disrepair and some completely disappeared. Today, the parts that remain are a major tourist attraction. The Great Wall of China is one of the wonders of the world, even if it really didn't succeed in its purpose of keeping the northern nomads out of China.",174.106125,177.13334324108357,Fast

3 Common Scripts That Control Your Life And Your English Ep 804-e4f18c.wav,"Hi there and welcome to this Adapt English podcast. Let's do a psychological topic for today. We haven't done one for a while. I make podcasts about lots of different topics and I do lots of research because often I'm learning about these topics just as you are. It's part of why I enjoy doing a depth English because I learn about things that are new to me too. But today let's cover something that's closer to home for me. Later this year I will have been a psychotherapist for over 25 years. That makes me feel old. But I guess you could say I have expertise in that. I'm pretty good at understanding human psychology. So today's podcast let's combine an interesting article that I read last week with some of my knowledge from my training and my practice. Have you ever heard the term unconscious script? And do you realise you may be living life in accordance with rules and beliefs that you're not fully aware of? Well that's the case for most of us. So today let's talk about unconscious scripts which rule our lives. So you might become more aware of them. You'll get lots of great English language listening today. Some wonderful vocabulary but also a really interesting topic. A subject that you might want to read about even in your own language. Hello I'm Hillary and you're listening to a depth English.

They're sitting waiting for you on our website adeptenglish.com on the courses page. You can download them and start those courses immediately. So back to today's topic. This week I read an article by An Law La Cum on Cognitive Scripts. In the magazine the big thing, the article is called the three cognitive scripts that subtly rule our lives. Publish 4th of March 2025. Very recent then. For vocabulary here, cognitive scripts, that's cog n it ive. Cognitive is an adjective and it just means thinking and the noun to go with that is cognition. Cognitive and cognition are the words that scientists and psychologists use to talk about our thinking and the idea of a script. SCRIPT. Well here that comes from psychology but the original meaning if you write a play PLAY for theatre or television then you would create a script. That means you'd write what the people in your play your drama are going to say. That's called a script. So actors, ACTOR have to learn their lines, learn their words in order to be able to act and these would come from the script. So what we are saying about this other psychological use of the words script is that we're all programmed differently. Our brains work differently. We think differently and that people's behaviour and thinking operate according to their script. Now I use the word unconscious. That just means we're not aware of it. The word used by the neuroscientists and law the cump is cognitive. It means pretty much the same thing except I guess I'm saying we're not always aware of our scripts. They're unconscious much of the time. So as a psychotherapist I guess you could say that one of the main parts of my job when working with someone is to help them uncover their cognitive or unconscious scripts. Just because something is your script, your usual way of behaving doesn't mean that you recognise that it's often unconscious or partly unconscious and it doesn't mean that it's the best way to be. You may realise that you're different from other people in particular ways in your habits, in your decisions and your thinking style, but you may not have uncovered your central script. Our scripts mean that we operate pretty much like characters in a play much of the time. We have certain ways of thinking and behaving. The reason why I personally prefer watching a series rather than a film in a series there might be 20 episodes. That's opportunity to really develop a character much more fully than there's time to in a film. If a series is well written it will make its characters feel like real people because they act true to themselves, true to script. So they have scripts in both senses of the word. The actor has learned their words from a script but the writer has made the character in the series true to their psychological script. It makes them believable. Just the same as in a good novel, a good book. So we each have our own personal and unique psychological script and in the world there are probably as many scripts as there are people. Our unique scripts grow as we do and develop and they take in the values, the beliefs of other people and the world around us. In the article I read and lore LeCumth talks about three very common cognitive scripts that she's encountered and which don't really help people or which narrow the range of choices that people make. She talks in the article about something she calls sequel script, SEQ-U-E-L meaning that if we make choices in life we must make those choices according to what we've already done. It must follow on from previous decisions. She says, we stick to careers we no longer enjoy, remain in relationships that no longer serve us and avoid exploring opportunities that seem inconsistent with who we have been. So I think this happens particularly in our jobs and careers and there are good external reasons why that's so too. I must take a job in banking because that's what I've done up to now and I like the salary. I must take a job in teaching because that's all I've ever known and I've not done anything else. Often what's familiar and known to us can feel much safer but it can mean we stay in a situation, a job, a relationship, a living arrangement much longer than we should because actually it no longer suits us but it is what we know. And law, the come, goes on. Another script that subtly governs our behaviour is the crowd pleaser script. Crowd, C-R-O-W-D is a group of people and pleaser, well that means you're someone who pleases people. So the crowd pleaser script. The pressure to conform to social expectations is very powerful and it often masquerades as wisdom and prudence. The word to masquerade, M-A-S-U-E-R-A-D-E means to pretend to be something you're not. In the UK the phrase we often use for this is people pleaser. You're a people pleaser, we say. If someone's a people pleaser, it means they really really care what other people think of them. They must be nice to other people at all times even when they're angry or being taken advantage of. They'll just smile and carry on because they don't want anyone to think badly of them or not like them. Worrying what other people think can really hold you back in life. But this is an everyday experience for lots of people. Women in particular can have social influences which make them into people pleasers. As the woman an extension of that is believing that you are there only for the benefit of your parents, your husband, your children, your identities around being a daughter, a wife, a mother, and your efforts in life must only be to support these roles and it can feel wrong to do something for yourself or just because you want to. That's quite a common version of being a people pleaser that sometimes social systems and societies promote. What people pleasing is across all cultures and genders. You probably know someone like this. The third common script that An Law LeCumph talks about the epic script that's EPIC. This is the belief that people's lives should evolve around one main purpose. Often when we're young we're trying to find the one thing that's meant for us to dedicate our lives to. An Law LeCumph sites research that suggests being too passionate about one thing means that we don't anticipate setbacks. We can be too idealistic and we get disillusioned and disappointed and some feel lost in life because they can't find their defining purpose at all. This can also happen when you've been pursuing a particular career. You reach your potential, you succeed and there's nowhere else to go. Maybe you retire. What on earth to do next? You've achieved your goals. What meaning does life now have? This I notice happens quite a bit when the successful business person finally sells that company that they've spent years building. They make their money but instead of enjoying themselves at home doing all the things they promised they feel unhappy and it's a moment of awful crisis. Another typical one, you've spent 20 years bringing up your children. Then they leave home. Maybe they're in contact once a month. This probably means you've done a good job of helping them be independent but this can leave parents without a role feeling unhappy. The main purpose of their lives doesn't need their effort anymore. The truth is that most people across a lifetime need multiple purposes, multiple goals. The meanings in our lives must evolve. As Anne-Law Le Comfe says, we are curious evolving beings with diverse interests. Embracing this fluidity can lead to a more fulfilling life. The scripts that Anne-Law Le Comfe points out are very common but there are many, many more. A couple of examples from me, once the IC, there's what I call the script of safety. SAFETY. This is when a person is extremely anxious and scared to do things. Every change, every challenge in life is met with great anxiety. A person with this script cannot get onto the train on their own and go to London or the nearest big city. They may depend hugely on other people. Going to the gym may be a big deal or the idea of staying by themselves in a hotel room of a night. These things might be absolutely unthinkable. They're just too anxious. For other people, even though they're perfectly able, their fears are around driving on the motorway or fast roads. It's just too anxiety-provoking. What's happened usually here is that when this person was a child, someone really important in their lives, portrayed the world out there as extremely dangerous and full of risks. Normal adult things like going on holiday, traveling, riding the bike, getting the new job or doing things on your own all have been portrayed as full of risk and probably not worth doing because of the risk. You're better staying home or close to home so that you're safe. That's how the unconscious script goes there. So the person with this script set up usually in childhood and when they were a teenager operates according to a personal script which is always about personal safety and reducing risk. I call this the script of safety because it's so common. One more common one. I have to be the best and I have to be 100% successful in everything. And often with this script goes the idea that if I score 99% in something, I'm a failure. If I score 100% at something, that's okay. I can just move to the next thing and get on with something else. The person with this type of script does not celebrate success. Success is treated as just normal. What I should be doing anyway. And anything just less than 100% success is a failure. Something to criticize oneself for, something to be ashamed of. As you can imagine, it's very hard to live like that. There is constant inner criticism. What human, what person achieves 100% success all the time? But that doesn't stop people with this type of cognitive script from trying. And often they achieve a great deal. They're often very successful, which sometimes makes the script worse because it may look as though that sought after perfection is just beyond reach. Just try a bit harder. Those are just a couple of the myriad. M-Y-R-I-A-D myriad of possible cognitive scripts that can govern a person's life. Scripting can of course come from parents, but also from experiences dynamics within families. Things like I must always be the peacemaker or I must escape and never be tied down by any relationship because all relationships might be like these ones in my family. There are examples of scripts that come from family dynamics. Schools and education, that also has a lot of input, positive or negative. As do many religions. And the culture and the social order of the world that we grew up in, that determines a lot of our cognitive scripting as well. Let me know whether you find these ideas interesting. Sometimes you can see them in yourself, but you can see them in other people too. Let me know also if you would like more psychology-based podcasts like this one. Enough for now. Have a lovely day.

short-stories-0247-250-florence-nightingale.wav,"Florence Nightingale It could be said that Florence Nightingale was responsible for inventing modern nursing. Indeed, Nightingale did open up the professions to women generally. Her example and influence during the mid to late 19th century were an important factor in opening doors to women. Nightingale's own life reflects many of these changes. She was born in 1820 and was one of two daughters of a wealthy English family. Her mother was a beautiful society lady who had once turned down a favored suitor because he was not wealthy enough. She wanted both her daughters to be socially popular and to marry rich and important men. Florence's father ensured that she had a good education, but she was frustrated because girls and women were always under parental supervision. She felt called to a life of action, but her family insisted that she divide her time between being with her family and attending social functions. She was not allowed to do anything on her own. When she was 16, Nightingale said that God spoke to her and called her to do his work. But Florence didn't know what work she was being called to do. Years passed away while she sat with her mother and sister or attended dances and concerts or travel to Europe. Nightingale became more angry and rebellious. She offended her family and friends by refusing to marry several prominent men who wanted to marry her. By the time she was 24, she had decided to be a nurse. But how did one become a nurse? At that time, the profession didn't seem promising. The only respectable nurses were those women and religious orders that ministered to the patient's spiritual health, but were not trained in medicine. The majority of nurses were poor, untrained women, who were suspected of being too fond of men or alcohol or both. In fact, one hospital preferred to hire unwed mothers as nurses because they had no reputations to lose. Nightingale's family was horrified by her plans. Their opposition delayed her plans, but could not stop them. In 1850, she visited a hospital in Germany for the first time. In 1853, she was appointed superintendent of a women's nursing home in London. But Florence was still waiting for her true calling. In 1855, the Times of London was printing reports from the Crimean War. France and England were fighting Russia in the Crimean Peninsula. After one allied victory, the wounded French soldiers were well taken care of, but the wounded English soldiers were left to die. Back in England, there was a public outcry. It was Florence's opportunity. She was soon on her way to Istanbul, Turkey, with 38 nurses. Scotari, Turkey, was the hospital where the British wounded were brought. This so-called hospital was a death pit, where 42 out of every 100 men died. The army was unwilling to listen to Miss Nightingale or to let her 10 the wounded. She had to wait until conditions became so bad that the regular medical officers were overwhelmed. As soon as the army turned to her, she immediately went to work. She had the entire hospital cleaned, a new kitchen set up, and a good water supply obtained. The death rate dropped to 22 out of every 1000. Nightingale became famous overnight. Although her efforts in the Crimean War injured her health, she continued her work back in London. She published a 1000-page report on medical conditions in the British army, several books on nursing, and her own proposals and suggestions. She also set up a training school for nurses. Long before her death in 1910, she had seen nursing become a well-established profession. Almost single-handedly, she had helped to bring about proper treatment of the sick and injured.",257.567375,146.05887100414017,Ideal

ielts-listening-0054-cam16-test-2-part-2.wav,"Good morning, and thank you for coming here today. I'd like to bring you up to date with changes in the school that will affect your children. As you know, the school buildings date from various times, some from the 1970s, some from the last five years, and of course, Dartfield House is over a century old. It was commissioned by a businessman, Neville Richards, and intended as his family home, but he died before it was completed. His heir chose to sell it to the local council, who turned it into offices. A later plan to convert it into a tourist information centre didn't come about through lack of money, and instead it formed the nucleus of this school when it opened forty years ago. The school has grown as the local population has increased, and I can now give you some news about the lower school site, which is separated from the main site by a road. Planning permission has been granted for development of both sites. The lower school will move to new buildings that will be constructed on the main site. Developers will construct houses on the existing lower school site. Work on the new school buildings should start within the next few months. A more imminent change concerns the catering facilities and the canteen. The canteen is always very busy throughout the lunch period. In fact, it's often full to capacity, because a lot of our pupils like the food that's on offer there, but there's only one serving point, so most pupils have to wait a considerable time to be served. This is obviously unsatisfactory, as they may have hardly finished their lunch before afternoon lesson start. So, we've had a new food hall built, and this will come into use next week. It'll have several serving areas, and I'll give you more details about those in a minute, but one thing we ask you to do to help in the smooth running of the food hall is to discuss with your children each morning which type of food they want to eat that day, so they can go straight to the relevant serving point. There won't be any junk food, everything on offer will be healthy, and there's no change to the current system of paying for lunches by topping up your child's electronic payment card online. You may be wondering what will happen to the old canteen. We'll still have tables and chairs in there, and pupils can eat food from the food hall or lunch they've brought from home. Eventually, we may use part of the canteen for storage, but first we'll see how many pupils go in there at lunchtime. Okay, back to the serving points in the food hall, which will all have side dishes, desserts, and drinks on sale, as well as main courses. One serving point we call world adventures. This will serve a different country's cuisine each day, maybe Chinese one day, and Lebanese the next. The menus will be planned for a week at a time, so pupils will know what's going to be available the whole of that week. Street life is also international, with food from three particular cultures. We'll ask pupils to make suggestions, so perhaps sometimes they'll be food from Thailand, Ethiopia, and Mexico, and then one of them will be replaced by Jamaican food for a week or two. The speedy Italian serving point will cater particularly for the many pupils who don't eat meat or fish. They can be sure that all the food served there is suitable for them. There'll be plenty of variety, so they shouldn't get bored with the food. Okay, that's all on the new food hall. Now, after school lessons. These are very popular with pupils, particularly swimming. In fact, there's a waiting list for lessons. Cycling is another favourite, and I'm delighted that dozens of pupils make use of the chance to learn to ride in off-road conditions. It means that more and more cycle to and from school every day. As you know, we have a well-equipped performance centre, and we're going to start drama classes in there too. Pupils will be able to join in just for fun, or work up to taking part in a play. We hope to put on at least one a year. We already teach a number of pupils to use the sound and lighting systems in the centre. And a former pupil has given a magnificent grand piano to the school, so a few pupils will be able to learn at the school instead of going to the local college as many of them do at the moment.",329.429375,142.61023322525506,Ideal
ielts-listening-0284-ielts-recent-actual-test-3-part-4.wav,"If there is one natural feature which has long fascinated man, it is caves, those natural underground spaces into which people can enter. No known cave in the world can exist without it being extensively explored. Whether it be in remote areas, such as the Clearwater Cave in Borneo, or immensely long and difficult, such as mammoth cave in America, or perhaps the most challenging, those caves below the water table, full with water, in which case the exploration is known as cave diving. Whatever the case, if the caves are known, as complex and difficult as they usually are, they will be explored. The formal name for the study of caves is Speleology, and involves many disciplines, such as chemistry, geology, biology, and cartography, or the science of making accurate maps, since the largest caves can be hundreds of kilometres long and highly complicated. If the exploration is just for fun, the activity is known as cave-ing, but with the difficulties and dangers involved, the average cave-er is often involved with one of these Speleological sciences. Most of the number of caves in the world research suggests that only a fraction have been found and documented, mostly in the areas in which cave-ing has long been a popular activity, such as in America, France, or Australia. China, for example, has huge areas of limestone bedrock, prime material for cave formation, and logically must contain among the largest number of caves in the world. Yet only few are documented due to the lack of interest in cave-ing there. Thus, as exploration continues, new caves will be discovered, and it is likely that the numbers could radically change in the future. With caves being such mysterious and intriguing places, the obvious question concerns how they form. The most common cause is the effect of slightly acidic water in a process called dissolution. Here, water seeps into the ground and down through rock masses. If this rock is soluble, the water dissolves some of it, and over time the passage expands to become a cave or cave system. The largest and most common of these involves limestone, although other materials are possible, including gypsum, marble, and even salt. Now, if the cave is formed at the same time as the rock, it is called a primary cave, and the most common of these are lava tubes. When lava from volcanoes flows downhill, the topmost surface cools and solidifies first, leaving the hotter lava to continue to flow beneath. With most of this eventually flows out, a hollow tube is left. The country Iceland has some excellent caves of this type, and even far flung Australia has a few. Finally, there are sea caves, formed from waves pounding into coastal cliffs, and eroding into fault lines or softer rock. These caves are usually the shortest, about 50 meters at most, since the erosive action of the waves can only reach a certain distance. However, it is limestone caves which will always be the most interesting. This is due to the presence of limestone formations. As the groundwater seats downward through the ceiling of the caves, it encounters a different pressure and temperature, causing it to deposit a small amount of its dissolved calcium carbonate. Over time, through the action of millions of drops, this deposition process results in ever-growing masses, known as stalactites, if hanging from the ceiling, or stalagmites if growing from the floor. Alternatively, the water may flow over a large surface of rock, forming flow stone, and with other sorts of processes, can result in beautiful milky-white formations of astonishing complexity. One of the best examples of this, as well as a what surprising discoveries may yet await, is the lecture Gila Cave in New Mexico. In the 1950s, some caveers heard the sound of wind underneath some large boulders on the cave floor, a clear sign of a deeper passageway. It took until 1984 for a group of caveers to gain permission to start digging, and two years later, in 1986, they broke through into a walkable passageway. I'm locking one of the longest cave systems in the world, the deepest in America, and some of the most beautiful formations ever found. Unusually, many of these were yellow with sulfur, suggesting that the caves were a result of hydrogen sulfide from nearby all deposits. This was forced through fracture lines, combining with existing groundwater, to form sulfuric acid. Disolving the limestone from the bottom up, instead of the normal top-down seepage, which characterizes most limestone cave formations.",342.6586875,132.72682601984226,Ideal

This year it is 2001, and on December 31st at midnight, it will change to 2002. I wonder who invented the changing of the years, and how it was made the way it is. It must have been someone a long time ago, since it's already 2001. When New Years comes closer, a lot of people talk about New Year's resolutions. I don't bother making resolutions, because I never do them anyway, and the ones I do make are usually ones that will happen anyway. I guess it's just common sense. The biggest reason why I like New Years is because of the fireworks that we have here in Canada and many other countries too. You should see some of the fireworks that go off. There are many different colors. There's pink, blue, purple, yellow, green, red, even white, silver and gold. Fireworks make loud bangs, squeals, siren sounds, and sometimes all at once. There are lots of different sounds, but I can't even explain what they are all like. Fireworks are best when it's very dark outside. They light up the whole sky. Sometimes they look as though they are going to fall on you. I like New Years because it's fun in other ways, but the fireworks are the best. You can buy fireworks to use for your own fireworks show. However, you have to be careful that no one gets burned or hurt. Usually there are parties at New Years. Some people really dress up fancy and even wear masks. They don't know who one another is until midnight when they take their masks off. As midnight comes very close, everybody begins to countdown, and then everyone yells out, Happy New Years! And bangs, pots, and pans, or rings, bells, or honk horns. Join me in the countdown on New Year's Eve. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Happy New Year!",143.0465625,147.2247891311614,Ideal

Her tiny lips are pucker-to-bit, her little eyelids flutter. I wonder what she dreams about as she sleeps. Does she dream? I have heard her whimper in her sleep. Sometimes she awakens with the scream. What is so scary in her little baby dreams? Sometimes I heard her giggle as she slept. Her dreams must have been sweet that day. I have had three babies. The one I am holding now is my last one. My other babies are grown up more, and now at school. I love their childish play and laughter. I miss their baby dimples and their babies' sounds and smells. There is such joy in the birth of a new baby. We hear their first little cry, telling us all as well with their small world. We feel their newborn skin, wrinkled, soft and slightly damp. We feel each little limb and are filled with wonder in humility. Life is good as baby takes its first food from its mother. Family gathers around, each waiting to hold and love this newest member. Each time the baby cries, it's mum worries, and their bond becomes stronger. Babies have their own special smell. Some have described it as milk and innocence. It is the sweetest smell on earth I think. It cannot be copied. Somehow it disappears as baby grows. I love to hear my baby talk. Once in a while I can even understand a little bit. She is so serious in her baby talk that I just have to pick her up and hug her. I love to hear her say, Mommy! When my baby is tickled or when the dog or her big brothers do something funny, it is so sweet to hear her baby laugh. It's such a cute little giggle. Sometimes she laughs so hard, her face turns red, tears come to her eyes, and she falls down weak with the laughter. Babies who watch her can't help but laugh too. I hope she always laughs so easily. The parents watch with pride and joy as baby grows and has many firsts. There is the first time baby sleeps through the night, rolls over, smiles, laughs, hugs and kisses. Then there is the first tooth, crawling, first step, and first word. With each new first, the baby becomes less a baby. These steps are a little sad to parents too, because they know they're losing their baby. However, to a mother, even an adult child is still her baby. My baby is not perfect.

We have lots of fascinating indoor and outdoor exhibits on our huge complex, spreading hundreds of hectares. Our remit is to give educational opportunities to the wider public, as well as to offer research sites for a wide variety of agriculturalists and other scientists. Let's start by seeing what there is to do. As you can see here on our Giant Wall Plan, we are now situated in the reception block here. As you walk out of the main door into the park, there's a path you can follow. If you follow this route, you'll immediately come into the Rare Breeds section, where we keep a wide variety of animals, which I shall be telling you a little more about later. Next to this, moving east, is the large grazing area for the Rare Breeds. Then further east, in the largest section of our park, is the forest area. South of the grazing area, and in fact, just next to the reception block is our experimental crop area. In the middle of the park, this circular area is our lake. These two small rectangular shapes here are the fish farms where we rear fish for sale. To the east of those is the marsh area, which attracts a great many migrant birds. In the south eastern corner, beyond the marsh, is our market garden area, growing vegetables and flowers. All these areas can be visited by the general public for almost all the year. Although, please take note of the large signs of the entrance to each area, which tell you when certain areas are being used for particular controlled experiments, and are therefore temporarily out of bounds to the public. You can see for yourself what a huge area the park covers, and a key question is always, how can we move around? Well, you have a choice of means. All environmentally friendly, a car's a band in the park. We have bicycles, which you can hire behind the reception block here, the healthy ones of you can go on foot, and finally there's our electric tram, powered from solar cells. You find more information about this at the front entrance. A good place to start on your tour is the rare breed section. We keep goats, sheep and hens and other kinds of poultry. We're also thinking of bringing cows and horses, but we do not, as yet, have facilities for these bigger animals. The animals are fed in public twice a day, and a short lecture, given on their feeding habits, and nutritional needs. These are very popular with the public, but of course, he mustn't lose sight of the main purpose of having this section, not as such to preserve rare animals, but to maintain the diversity of breeds, to broaden the gene pool for agricultural development. Greenvale changes with the seasons, with different events happening at different times of the year. May will be perhaps our most spectacular month, with the arrival of the Canada geese, and when our fruit trees will be in full blossom. But there are interesting events on all year round, for example, John Havers, our expert fly fisherman, is currently giving displays on the lake. Each of the sections has its own seasonal calendar, and please consult the summary board at the main entrance. And the final section, as we return to the reception blocks, is the orchard. Do take time to browse around our shop, if there's a wide selection of books on wildlife, some of them written by local authors, and the history of farming, including organic farming.

ielts-listening-0072-cam15-test-2-part-4.wav,"I'm going to report on a case study of a program which has been set up to help rural populations in Mozambique, a largely agricultural country in South East Africa. The program worked with three communities in Chiquala-Quala District near the Limpopo River. This is a dry and arid region with unpredictable rainfall. Because of this, people in the area were unable to support themselves through agriculture, and instead they used the forest as a means of providing themselves with an income, mainly by selling charcoal. However, this was not a sustainable way of living in the long term, as they were rapidly using up this resource. To support agriculture in this dry region, the program focused primarily on making use of existing water resources from the Limpopo River by setting up systems of irrigation, which would provide a dependable water supply for crops and animals. The program worked closely with the District Government in order to find the best way of implementing this. The region already had one farmer's association, and it was decided to set up two more of these. These associations planned and carried out activities including water management, livestock breeding and agriculture, and it was notable that in general women formed the majority of the workforce. It was decided that in order to keep the crops safe from animals, both wild and domestic, special areas should be fenced off where the crops could be grown. The community was responsible for creating these fences, but the program provided the necessary wire for making them. Once the area had been fenced off, it could be cultivated. The land was dug so that vegetables and cereals appropriate to the climate could be grown, and the program provided the necessary seeds for this. The program also provided pumps, so that water could be brought from the river in pipes to the fields. However, the labour was all provided by local people, and they also provided and put up the posts that supported the fences around the fields. Once the program had been set up, its development was monitored carefully. The farmers were able to grow enough produce, not just for their own needs, but also to sell. However, getting the produce to places where it could be marketed was sometimes a problem. As the farmers did not have access to transport, and this resulted in large amounts of produce, especially vegetables being spoiled. This problem was discussed with the farmers associations, and it was decided that in order to prevent food from being spoiled, the farmers needed to learn techniques for its preservation. There was also an additional initiative that had not been originally planned, but which became a central feature of the program. This was when farmers started to dig holes for tanks in the fenced-off areas, and to fill these with water and use them for breeding fish. An important source of protein. After a time, another suggestion was made by local people, which hadn't been part of the program's original proposal, but which was also adopted later on. They decided to try setting up colonies of bees, which would provide honey, both for their own consumption and to sell. So what lessons can be learned from this program? First of all, it tells us that in dry, arid regions, if there is access to a reliable source of water, there is great potential for the development of agriculture. In Chiquala-Quala, there was a marked improvement in agricultural production, which improved food security and benefited local people by providing them with both food and income. However, it's important to set realistic timelines for each phase of the program, especially for its design, as mistakes made at this stage may be hard to correct later on. The program demonstrates that sustainable development is possible in areas where there is...",365.5631875,105.04339964482884,Ideal

ielts-listening-0120-cam12-test-2-part-4.wav,"Over the years, attitudes towards workers have changed considerably. After all, there was a time when workers had no rights at all and labored in appalling conditions. Conditions have improved a lot, but conflict in the workplace is still common. And human resources managers nowadays need to be able to deal with it when necessary. What is conflict in the workplace? Definitions vary, but I'm taking it to refer to a whole range of behaviours that the victim finds unacceptable. From minor harmless arguments to, at the opposite extreme, physical violence. Much of this is covered by the term bullying, by which I mean one or more people behaving abusively or aggressively against another who is in a weaker position. Although all behaviour like this is a form of conflict, not all conflict can be described in these terms. As with all human behaviour, there are numerous reasons for it, but often it's caused by someone who feels the need to show their superiority over someone else. In order to feel that they aren't at the lowest level in a hierarchy or a group of people. In some cases, one person simply dislikes the other. On the basis that the personality of one is in some way incompatible with that of the other person. A general habit of optimism in one person could make them intolerant of a colleague who's constantly pessimistic. Not that that justifies treating them badly, of course. Some conflicts arise when people are more interested in promoting themselves and their team than in the company as a whole. These conflicts are called structural and could come about, for example, when a sales team believe they are the only people in the business who do any useful work and look down on behind the scenes administrators. Conflict obviously affects the individual's concern. The situation is likely to be very stressful for victims, resulting in their absence from work, possibly for months. For the company, if no effort is made to deal with conflict, it can spiral out of control and even lead to the breakdown of the business. Some interesting work with chief executives, CEOs, has uncovered some of the reasons why they may treat colleagues badly. Many CEOs combine two opposing characteristics. Confidence, that is the belief that they are capable of great achievements with a high level of anxiety, a fear of missing targets, whether set by themselves or by the directors of the company. This combination can make them respond badly to anyone who questions their decisions. In a high pressure work environment, such characteristics become problematic and it's particularly difficult to tackle the situation where colleagues, managers and board members are all trying to achieve their own visions. When they can't agree on strategic issues and on where they see the business going, there are real problems. For managers at lower levels within the organisation, it might seem that an autocratic form of management, where the chief executive gives orders and everyone else has to obey, would see more conflict than others. Interestingly though, a company with a more democratic business model can suffer more when uncertainty about who to report to leads to conflicting demands. Now I'll say a little about dealing with the type of conflict that has harmful effects. Of course, the ideal is to prevent it arising in the first place. A good manager at any level will make efforts to earn the respect of the people they work with. Particularly those who report to them. That will involve politeness in all communications and treating them as equals who happen to have a different role within the organisation. Sometimes of course, conflict does occur and can get out of hand. In such cases, the human resources department often gets involved. However, if one of the parties in a conflict sees human resources as simply a mouthpiece for the chief executive, then an external mediator might be able to help. By talking to both sides and trying to find the truth of what's been happening, they can build a clear picture of the situation and give feedback that both sides will accept, precisely because they're independent.",384.820875,108.5180215340449,Ideal

Now as ever positive news stories are quite hard to find, but one of the areas where there do tend to be more positive news stories, success is around the environment. So this week reports that said in 2024 95% of the power used in France was fossil free. That's fossil F O S S I L and here we're talking fossil fuels. So that means oil gas coal fuels extracted from the ground in other words 95% fossil free energy. That is a remarkable achievement by France and the rest of the world should be looking to France to see how they've done this. This relies heavily on nuclear fuel. That's N U C L E A R. Despite having very strong opinions against nuclear fuel when I was younger, I do now see that we have little choice but to make greater use of nuclear energy and safety levels are much more assured now than they were in the 1980s. So nuclear fuel made up 67% of France's total energy use last year. After that came renewables at 28%. So that means things like hydro power, that's hydro HYDRO or using water's force to capture energy in other words. Hydro power accounted for much of that 28% renewable energy. Surprisingly given how hot it can be in the summer in the south of France, solar power that's S O L A R accounted for only 4% of the power generated. The UK of course does far worse than this. We really should be learning lessons from the French. What a remarkable achievement and one which I hope will be emulated around the world. Actually that new story was quite difficult to find. Why don't we celebrate this type of thing more and why isn't the UK's energy policy to copy what France has done? Another positive news story concerning the environment which so easily slips off the agenda don't you notice. Apparently in Denmark in the city of Ahus, that's A A R H U S, a project was started in January 2024 to get cafes in the city to use only recyclable cups for to go coffee. In a coffee shop in English you'll be asked when you order is that sit in or to go. If you sit in that means you sit at a table in the cafe you'll get a ceramic cup and saucer. If you say to go you'll get a cardboard cup to take away. Even with a plastic lid these of course aren't necessarily recyclable or people don't recycle them. So the to go coffee cups are the ones that you take with you. Some people remember to take their own reusable coffee cup with them but not many people do this. So the Danish project proposed that all cafes in the city of Ahus put their to go coffee into reusable cups. More expensive then. And they asked people to return these reusable cups. You might imagine that people didn't return these cups and the scheme ended up costing the cafes a lot of money. But actually the good people of Ahus returned no fewer than 735,000 reusable cups in 2024. Let's practice some English on statistics here. 735,000 was much bigger than the 500,000 target set for the scheme and amazing 88% of the cups were returned. Even more surprising they calculated that this meant each cup was used 44 times and this prevented 14 tons of single use plastic ending up in landfill or having to be burned and the CO2 that would result from that. The scheme is believed to have been a success so far because the cups are returned to machines in the streets in the city centre. Worldwide it's estimated that only 2% of to go coffee cups end up recycled. So there's a long way to go on this one but another positive example to follow. Let's go slightly further afield for our third positive news story. Most of us love tigers that's TIGER. I don't think I'd want to be confronted by one in my back garden but they really are the most beautiful animals. And there has been concern about the numbers of tigers for decades now. A decade DEC ADE means 10 years. What countries of the world have tigers roaming free? Most of them are in Asia, countries like India, Thailand, Bhutan, Vietnam. But the populations of tigers in many of these countries are scaryly small. There are tigers also in Russia. The latest Russian survey in 2015 estimated that tiger populations there had increased to between 480 and 540 tigers. It's still not that many is it. What the positive news? In the early 2000s, tiger territory in India had reduced to only 10% of what it once was. But in January this year, scientists announced that tiger populations in India had doubled since 2010. There are now over 3,500 tigers in India. That's much more than anywhere else and is 75% of the world's tiger population. How have they achieved this? Well, strict measures rules against poaching that's POACH to poach or killing tigers in other words. Those measures have been put in place and there are increased tiger reserves and tiger corridors, areas of land or tigers put aside. Again, what India has done should be copied by the other countries of the world. What a brilliant example. Let us know what you think. I'll be interested to hear from you. What about one more good news story just before we finish? This one is from the UK. The UK is known for its wonderful countryside. There are so many places to walk and see beautiful views. If you visit the UK and you want to experience the country, beyond the big cities of London, Birmingham and Manchester, there are some wonderful places to visit which are just pure countryside. My personal favourite place for walking and for views of the lakes and mountains is the lake district in the northwest of England. But there are plenty of other national parks as well, preserved areas of land like the peak district, the Yorkshire Dales, Dartmoor or the South Dands. And there are also very many areas of outstanding natural beauty or AOMVs and these are protected too. So walking or hiking, that's from the verb to hype H-I-K-E. Well, it's a national pastime. And one important part of this is public footpaths and rights of way. A public footpath is protected by law. You're allowed to walk there. Public bridal ways are similarly protected but they can be used not only for walkers but also for cyclists and people on horse bike. There is also something called a right of way overland. Again, this means that a pathway across the piece of land is protected so that walkers can use it. The land owner or the person who owns the land must allow people along this path, along the right of way, whether they want to or not. Apparently, a path used by walkers can be registered as a right of way if it's been in use for 20 years or more. There are thousands and thousands of miles of rights of way already recorded but they're also remain thousands and thousands of pathways which have been used for more than 20 years but which are yet to be registered as rights of way. Even though they're in constant use by cyclists, walkers and people on horse bike. In their great wisdom, the UK government was going to stop any more registrations of rights of way after 2031. I don't know whose bright idea that was. Why would you have a cutoff date for recording rights of way? Anyway, the good news, Sense House prevailed, Sense House won for once. The 2031 deadline has been removed and it will continue to be possible to register new rights of way for walkers, cyclists and people on horse bike. Even being able to walk sometimes over private land, if there is right of way, is an important part of British culture. It protects people's right to walk and it makes sure that ordinary people have the right to see beautiful countryside. Instead of this being kept only for rich land owners. If it wasn't for these rights and these laws, there would be very few places where you could walk your dog, go for a cycle ride or ride on horseback. Finally, something good. Great then that the UK government have seen sense on this one and we will continue to be able to register new rights of way way beyond 2031. Do you have public footpaths, rights of way or similar schemes in your country? Let us know what you think of this new story or any of the others that I've talked through today. I feel as though we really need positive news stories at the moment. To do get in touch as well, if you have any positive news stories to share, we always like to hear from you.

Oh no, they are coming to my door! The doorbell chimes, and I slowly open the door. There, standing on my front porch, is a little ghost, and a cute little witch. They hold up a bag and say, trick or treat. I put candy into their bags, and they smile and say, thank you! Every October 31st is Halloween. That is when children dress up as different things. Not just funny people, but things like animals or fruits or vegetables. They go from door to door and get different candies or little toys from the people in the houses. Some children, who are not very nice, will do naughty things to houses where people are not home, like throwing eggs at their windows. I think that is bad. Sometimes people decorate their houses for this day. Some of the houses can be pretty scary. They'll have scary noises coming from a tape recorder, too. However, it's only for a few days out of the year, so we may as well have fun with it. This year my brother is dressing up as a skeleton, and I'm dressing up as a bride. I am wearing my mom's wedding dress. It is fun dressing up in costumes and putting on lots of makeup. Sometimes our friends don't even know who we really are. The best part of Halloween is the candy, of course. I once got an entire garbage bag full of candy. My mom and dad took it away because I was eating too much. Mom gave me a piece of candy every day, though. If you eat too much candy, you can get a stomach ache. You need to remember to brush your teeth often too, so you don't get cavities.

ielts-listening-0134-cam11-test-2-part-2.wav,"Hi, great to see you. I'm Jodie and I'll be looking after both of you for the first month you're working here at the Amisham Theatre. I'll tell you something about the theatre now, then take you to meet two of the other staff. It's an old building and it's been modernised several times. In fact, as you can see, we're carrying out a major refurbishment at the moment. The interior has just been repainted and we're about to start on the exterior of the building. That'll be a big job. The work's running over budget, so we've had to postpone installing an elevator. I hope you're happy running up and downstairs. When the theatre was built, people were generally slimmer and shorter than now and the seats were very close together. We've replaced them with larger seats, with more legroom. This means fewer seats in total, but we've taken the opportunity to install seats that can easily be moved to create different acting spaces. We've also turned a few store rooms over to other purposes, like using them for meetings. We try hard to involve members of the public in the theatre. One way is by organising backstage tours, so people can be shown round the building and learn how a theatre operates. These are proving very popular. What we're finding is that people want to have lunch or a cup of coffee while they're here, so we're looking into the possibility of opening a cafe in Duke Horse. We have a bookshop, which specialises in books about drama, and that attracts plenty of customers. Then there are two large rooms that will be decorated next month, and they'll be available for hire, for conferences and private functions, such as parties. We're also considering hiring out costumes to amateur drama clubs. Now I want to tell you about our workshops. We recently started a programme of workshops that anyone can join. Eventually we intend to run courses in acting, but we're waiting until we've got the right people in place as trainers. That's proving more difficult than we'd expected. There's a big demand to learn about the technical side of putting on a production, and our lighting workshop has already started with great success. We're going to start one on sound next month. A number of people have inquired about workshops on makeup, and that's something we're considering for the future. A surprise success is the workshop on making puppets. We happen to have someone working here who does it as a hobby, and she offered to run a workshop. It was so popular we're now running them every month. Now a word about the layout of the building. The auditorium, stage and dressing rooms for the actors are all below ground level. Here on the ground floor we have most of the rooms that the public doesn't see. The majority are internal, so they have windows in the roof to light them. Standing here in the foyer, you're probably wondering why the box office isn't here, where the public would expect to find it. Well, you might have noticed it on your way in. Although it's part of this building, it's next door with a separate entrance from the road. For the theatre manager's office, you go across the foyer and through the double doors. Turn right and it's the room at the end of the corridor with the door on the left. The lighting box is where the computerized stage lighting is operated and it's at the back of the building. When you're through the double doors, turn left, turn right at the water cooler and right again at the end. It's the second room along that corridor. The lighting box has a window into the auditorium, which of course is below us. The artistic directors office is through the double doors, turn right and it's the first room you come to on the right hand side. And finally, for the moment, the room where I'll take you next, the relaxation room. So, if you'd like to come with me?",289.360125,141.62283072002404,Ideal

ielts-listening-0278-ielts-recent-actual-test-2-part-2.wav,"Hello everyone and welcome to the Stanfield Chowkair Centre. Now I know you're all new mothers and you like to cling to your children. You've certainly spent a lot of time raising them to the age of four and are perhaps reluctant to leave them here at our centre. Well, one of the first things you should understand is that here it is safe, very safe. Look around and you'll see that every room has padded walls. Other centres have standard painted walls, but here we have invested a lot to ensure your children will not hurt themselves when running around and possibly tripping over. This padding extends around all corners, that is the areas most likely to bruise and cut your active little child. So you can rest assured that any accidents of a physical nature are not likely to happen here. Now, you don't want to dump your child at this centre and let them waste their time. You want them to learn and that's one of the greatest assets of our establishment. Our staff are not only trained childcare workers, but all of them have a special skill which they can impart to your child. Whether it be teaching the ABC, some basic mathematics, artistic skills or physical education. We are particularly known for our preschool literacy program and have a wealth of learning toys, specially designed to develop your child's potential. Of course, one concern many mothers have is that in environments such as these, colds and fluis and other vionastes can be easily spread around. It's a very legitimate concern and one which we take seriously and we pride ourselves on our precautions. For a start, unlike most centres which clean with standard detergents, we disinfect every service at the end of every day, using a special disinfectant wash. Some places just wipe surfaces daily with a damp cloth, but not us, and that's just the start. We also physically check your children when they arrive every day, and if we feel your child is sick, we ask him or her to wear a face mask to ensure germs are not transmitted. If your child is noticeably sick, then we ask you to take them back home to recover. This might sound a little unkind, but we hope parents can understand that these measures are for the benefit of all. Now at Stanfield Child Care Centre, we have excellent childcare officers, and let me briefly introduce them. We have Susan, Andrea, Bella, Kathy, Lisa and Liz. They're all fully trained and come with some individual assets which make them even better. Bella for instance, knows children very well, having worked here for five years, and Kathy has her own family, two little girls, so she can talk to you with first hand knowledge of what it's really like to raise children. But getting back to Bella, she often relaxes here after work, spending long hours chatting to parents, as does Kathy in fact. But in terms of hours, nothing can compare to Andrea, who will sometimes spend the night here, staying in our overnight room. Why? Because this centre is very friendly and simply a great place to be. Bella, for example, used to be quite shy herself. But now is marvellous with the little kiddies, as outgoing as any of them. We let Kathy though deal with the particularly quiet and introverted children, since having her own family, she knows what can really bring them out. Of course, what better way to do this than with yummy homemade cakes, and Kathy often gets these from Bella, who can make some of the best in town. Yes, everyone here brings something special, which is why we're one of the best childcare centres in the business.",252.2034375,149.87900392911973,Ideal

ielts-listening-0200-cam7-test-2-part-4.wav,"My topic is hand-diveness. Whether in different sports it is better to be left or right-sided, or whether a more balanced approach is more successful. I'm left-handed myself, and I actually didn't see any relevance to my own life when I happened to start reading an article by a sports psychologist called Peter Matthews. He spent the first part of the article talking about hand-diveness in music instead of sport, which I have to say almost put me off from reading further. But what I soon became struck by was the sheer volume of both observation and investigation he had done in many different sports, and I felt persuaded that what he had to say would be of real interest. I think Matthews findings will be beneficial, not so much in helping sports people to work on their weaker side, but more that they can help them identify the most suitable strategies to use in a given game. Although most trainers know how important hand-diveness is, at present they are rather reluctant to make use of the insights scientists like Matthews can give, which I think is rather short-sighted, because focusing on individual flexibility is only part of the story. Anyway, back to the article. Matthews found a German study which looked at what he called mixed-handedness, that is the capacity to use both left and right hands equally. It looked at mixed-handedness in 40 musicians on a variety of instruments. Researchers examined a number of variables, for example type of instrument played, regularity of practice undertaken, and length of time playing instrument, and found the following. Keyboard players had high levels of mixed-handedness, whereas string players like cellists and violinists strongly favored one hand. Also, those who started younger were more mixed-handed. Matthews also reports studies of hand-diveness in apes. Apes get a large proportion of their food by fishing ants from ant hills. The studies show that apes, like humans, show hand-diveness, though for them right and left-handedness is about equal, whereas about 85% of humans are right-handed. Studies showed that apes consistently using the same hand, fished out 30% more ants than those varying between the two. Matthews started researching several different sports, and found different types of hand-diveness in each. By the way, he uses hand-diveness to refer to the dominant side for feet and eyes, as well as hands. Anyway, his team measured the hand, feet, and eyes of 2,611 players, and found that there were really three main types of laterality. Mixed, you work equally well on both sides, both hand and eye. Single, you tend to favor one side, but both hand and eye favor the same side. And cross laterality, a player's hands and eyes favor only one side, but they are opposite sides. Let's start with hockey. Matthews found that it was best to be mixed-handed. This is because a hockey stick must be deployed in two directions. It would be a drawback to have hand or eye favoring one side. An interesting finding is that mixed-handed hockey players were significantly more confident than their single-handed counterparts. Things are slightly different in racket sports like tennis. Here, the important thing is to have the dominant hand and eye on the one side. This means that there is a bigger area of vision on the side where most of the action occurs. If a player is cross-lateral, the racket is invisible from the dominant eye for much of the swing. It means that they can only make corrections much later, and often the damage has been done by then. And moving to a rather different type of sport, which involves large but precise movements, gymnastics. It's been found that cross-hand-eye favoring is best. The predominant reason for this is because it aids balance, which is, of course, absolutely central to performance in this sport.",305.4483125,126.10971618970721,Ideal

short-stories-0205-206-canadian-rocky-mountains.wav,"Canadian Rocky Mountains Some of the best known mountains scenery on Earth is concentrated in a set of seven parks in the Canadian Rocky Mountains. There are four national parks in the Canadian Rockies, Banff, Jasper, Yohau, and Koudne, and three British Columbia provincial parks, Mount Robsen, Mount Asinaboyne, and Hamburg. The seven preserves located along the Alberta British Columbia border attract more than nine million people annually. Banff National Park became Canada's first national park in 1985 and the birthplace of Canada's National Park System. It is home to a variety of distinctive natural features and cultural and historical sites. Rugged mountains, glaciers, ice fields, alpine meadows, beautiful blue cold water lakes, mineral hot springs, deep canyons, and hudus can pose the natural landscape and habitat for a great variety of mammals such as elk, big horn sheep, black and grizzly bear, and caribou. Jasper National Park is the largest and most northerly of the Canadian Rocky Mountain parks. The park is less commercialized than Banff, so it can still keep many natural beauties in scenery. Its scenery includes deeply gouged malign canyon, picturesque malign lake, the thunder of Sunwapta Falls, the serene beauty of glacier-covered Mount Edith Kovell, and Mi'et Hot Springs. As one of 39 national parks in Canada, Koudne National Park represents the southwestern slopes of the Canadian Rocky Mountains. From glacier-clad peaks to semi-arid grasslands, where even cactus grows, Koudne is rich in variety, and is one of the largest protected areas in the world. Yo-ho National Park, representing the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains region, holds the secrets of ancient ocean life, the power of ice and water, and unique plant and animal communities that continue to evolve today. A and wonder is a natural response for this place of rock walls, spectacular waterfalls, and soaring peaks. The Burgess Shale contains one of the world's most significant finds of soft-bodied, middle-cambrion-age marine fossils, with about 150 species, including some bearing no resemblance to known animals. These four Canadian national parks account for 14,300 square miles.

short-stories-0187-188-the-rights-of-the-accused.wav,"The rights of the accused. In English-speaking countries, the rights of an accused person are taken very seriously. Over many centuries, laws evolved in such a way that people could not be arrested or charged without a very good reason. Of course, every country needs to enforce its laws. This means that police officers are needed, and so are prosecutors, the lawyers whose job is to make criminal charges against people who break the laws, and to prove that those charges are true. However, it is very important that people's freedoms are not taken away wrongly. People should not be punished unfairly, and people who are accused of crimes must have the opportunity to defend themselves. In some parts of the world, people can be arrested and imprisoned for long periods of time, without any criminal charges being made against them. One of the most important principles of justice in English-speaking countries is that a person cannot be held by the police unless that person is charged with a crime. This principle is known by the Latin term, Habers Corpus. According to the idea of Habers Corpus, the police are not allowed to detain a person for more than a certain period of time, usually 24 hours, unless some charges made against the person. A judge will order the release of a person who is not charged with a crime. Another important feature of justice systems in most English-speaking countries is that accused individuals have the right to be represented by a lawyer. Most accused people want to hire an expert lawyer. However, even if a person cannot afford to hire a lawyer, the criminal court must provide a lawyer who will represent that person. The lawyer for an accused person is required to defend that person as thoroughly as possible. One of the most important aspects of justice systems in the United States and the British Commonwealth is that an accused person must be fully informed of any charges made against them. Also, any evidence that will be used to show the accused person's guilt must be shared with the accused person and with that person's lawyer. In this way, accused persons can challenge the truth of any evidence that will be used against them. Similarly, any person who acts as a witness against an accused person can be cross-examined by the accused person's lawyer. This means that the statements of a witness can be challenged by the accused person. Another important element of most English-speaking justice systems is that evidence must be obtained fairly. Police officers cannot simply enter a person's home to look for evidence of a crime. They must first have a good reason to believe that a crime has been committed, and they must obtain permission from a judge to enter the person's property. This permission is called a search warrant. Because search warrants are required, people are free from arbitrary invasions of their property by police. Finally, another important aspect of most English-speaking justice systems is that trials must be held in public, where other citizens can watch the trial. An accused person is not tried secretly. Moreover, as discussed in another passage, the accused person has the right to be tried by a jury of other free citizens. All of these rules ensure that order can be maintained without taking away the freedom of innocent people.",215.0139375,157.10609457584582,Fast

Let's take academic counseling. If you're confused about subjects or how to combine them in your degree, then we can advise you and discuss the career you are aiming for so that you can see it all in context. We can also chase up your tutor if you're not getting proper feedback on how you are getting on in your subject. Besides help with academic problems, you may also need personal counseling. If you think you're already under stress, well, just wait till classes begin next week. You'll have to start adjusting to teaching and learning methods that may be unfamiliar to you, as well as the mounting pressure as the deadline for that first assignment creeps up on you. And of course you have to cope with all this without your usual social network. You know the social contacts, family and friends, you could normally rely on for help. All of this causes anxiety. Studying overseas can trigger a personal crisis. You may have left a lot of what you might call unfinished business back in your own country. Or you may have interrupted personal relationships or even sometimes have broken them off to come overseas. And so the student often feels lonely, unhappy, unmotivated and unable to concentrate on studying. Or there may be other things bothering you. Our resident chaplain can offer you spiritual guidance if that's what you want, or we can put you in touch with community groups that can provide you with social contacts and friendship. What about exam stress? It affects nearly everyone, to some extent, but especially overseas students like yourselves. There may be a huge amount of family pressure on you to succeed. And if you fail a subject, or drop out of a course because it's too difficult, then your self-esteem can suffer. But it's not the end of the world if you don't pass an exam. I had to reset first year anthropology, so I can certainly offer you a sympathetic year. Anyway, exam failure can lead to worrying changes in the way you normally behave. You may also be off your food, or you may have dietary problems because the local food is not to your liking and upsets you, and this can affect your health and studies. Glenda Roberts is our dietitian in the health service, and we can put you under her. And we all have money problems, don't we? But remember, full-time students can get a low interest loan of up to $600 to buy books, and for similar study-related expenses. But that's right. And you can get double that amount if you can't afford an item of equipment you need for your course, a musical instrument, for example. And it doesn't stop there. When you move into a flat, starting up expenses, including furniture for it, can be covered by a loan through the welfare service. See Jill Freeman for details. Can we help you? Well, last academic year, in spite of staff cuts, we counseled 240 international students for a total of 2600 hours counseling. And finally, we won all but just one of the 12 appeals that we launched on behalf of students. Not too bad for an understaffed service, don't you think? That's all from me.

short-stories-0166-167-canada-provinces-and-territories.wav,"Canada, provinces and territories. Canada is one of the largest countries in the world. It is located in the northern half of the continent of North America above the United States. Canada is divided into 10 provinces and three territories each of which is different from the others. The province of British Columbia is located at the far western end of Canada. British Columbia stretches from the Pacific Ocean at the west to the Rocky Mountains at the east. British Columbia contains the city of Vancouver where two million people live. Most of the land of British Columbia is very mountainous with vast forests covering the mountains. In British Columbia forestry is an important industry providing wood for people around the world. Moving east from British Columbia the next provinces are Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. These are known as the Prairie provinces because they are mostly made of flat grassy land called Prairie. Alberta is the province where the flat prairie meets the tall beautiful Rocky Mountains. In Alberta there are many fields where oil and gas are found and there are also many farms where cattle are raised. Saskatchewan is the province that grows the most wheat. Wheat from Saskatchewan is sent around the world to make bread and pasta for many people. Manitoba is the other Prairie province. Its largest city Winnipeg is about halfway between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Winnipeg has the coldest winters of any large city in the world with temperatures sometimes reaching negative 40 degrees Celsius. Moving east the next province is Ontario. The land in the northern part of Ontario is very rocky and contains many thousands and thousands of lakes. Many mines are found in northern Ontario. In the southern part of Ontario there is good farmland and there are also many cities where factories produce cars and steel. Ontario contains Canada's largest city, Toronto as well as the capital city of Canada, Ottawa. In the southern part of Ontario are four of the largest lakes in the world known as the Great Lakes. Next to Ontario is the province of Quebec. Unlike the other provinces where most people speak English most of the people in Quebec speak French. The capital of Quebec is called Quebec City and this is one of the oldest cities in North America. Quebec City contains many buildings that are hundreds of years old. Also in the province of Quebec is the city of Montreal. Of all the French speaking cities in the world only Paris is larger than Montreal. In the eastern part of Canada are the Atlantic provinces which are next to the Atlantic Ocean. These provinces are New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland. In the Atlantic provinces fishing is an important industry. Tourism is also important as many people come to see the beauty of these provinces. The people in these provinces are said to be the friendliest in Canada. In the far north of Canada are the three territories that lie beside the Arctic Ocean. Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavik. Many of the people in these territories are the native people of Canada known as the Indians and the Inuit. The northern areas have very cold dark winters.

ielts-listening-0026-cam18-test-3-part-2.wav,"This evening we're delighted to welcome Dan Beagle, who's just written a book on looking for and finding food in the wild. He's going to tell us everything we need to know about picking wild mushrooms. Thank you very much. Well, I need to start by talking about safety. You really need to know what you're doing because some mushrooms are extremely poisonous. Having said that, once you know what to look for, it's really worth doing for the amazing variety of mushrooms available, which you can't get in the shops. But of course, you have to be very careful, and that's why I always say you should never consume mushrooms picked by friends or neighbors. Always remember that some poisonous mushrooms look very similar to edible ones, and it's easy for people to get confused. The other thing to avoid is mushrooms growing beside busy roads for obvious reasons. But nothing beats the taste of freshly picked mushrooms. Don't forget that the ones in the shops are often several days old, and pass their best. There are certain ideas about wild mushrooms that it's important to be aware of. Don't listen to people who tell you that it's only okay to eat mushrooms that are pale or dull. This is completely untrue. Some edible mushrooms are bright red, for example. Personally, I prefer mushrooms cooked, but it won't do you any harm to eat them uncooked in salads. It's not necessary to peel them. Another thing you should remember is that you can't tell if a mushroom is safe to eat by its smell. Some of the most deadly mushrooms have no smell, and taste quite nice, apparently. Finally, just because deer or squirrels eat a particular mushroom doesn't mean that you can. Of course, mushroom picking is associated with the countryside, but if you haven't got a car, your local park can be a great place to start. There are usually a range of habitats where mushrooms grow, such as playing fields and wooded areas. But you need to be there first thing in the morning, as there's likely to be a lot of competition. Not just from people, but wildlife too. The deer often get the best mushrooms in my local park. If you're a complete beginner, I wouldn't recommend going alone or relying on photos in a book, even the water I've written. There are some really good phone apps for identifying mushrooms, but you can't always rely on getting a good signal in the middle of a wood. If possible, you should go with a group led by an expert. You'll stay safe and learn a lot that way. A question is a really important consideration, and you must follow a few basic rules. You should never pick all the mushrooms in one area. Collect only enough for your own needs. Be very careful that you don't trample on young mushrooms or other plants. And make sure you don't pick any mushrooms that are endangered and protected by law. There's been a decline in some varieties of wild mushrooms in this part of the country. Restaurants are becoming more interested in locally sourced food like wild mushrooms. But the biggest problem is that so many new houses have been built in this area in the last ten years. And more water is being taken from rivers and reservoirs because of this, and mushroom habitats have been destroyed. Anyway, a word of advice on storing mushrooms. Collect them in a brown paper bag, and as soon as you get home, put them in the fridge. They'll be fine for a couple of days, but it's best to cook them as soon as possible. After washing them really carefully, first of course. So everybody knows what a mushroom tastes like, right? Well, you'll be surprised by the huge variety of wild mushrooms there are. Be adventurous. They're great in so many dishes. Stir fries, risottoes, pasta. But just be aware that some people can react badly to certain varieties. So it's a good idea not to eat huge quantities to begin with.

ielts-listening-0108-cam13-test-3-part-4.wav,"Last week we started looking at reptiles, including crocodiles and snakes. Today I'd like us to have a look at another reptile, the lizard. And in particular, at some studies that have been done on a particular type of lizard, whose Latin name is Taliqua Rugosa. This is commonly known as the sleepy lizard, because it's quite slow in its movements and spends quite a lot of its time dosing under rocks or lying in the sun. I'll start with a general description. Sleepy lizards live in Western and South Australia, where they're quite common. Unlike European lizards, which are mostly small, green and fast moving, sleepy lizards are brown, but what's particularly distinctive about them is the colour of their tongue, which is dark blue, in contrast with the lining of their mouth, which is bright pink. And they're much bigger than most European lizards. They have quite a varied diet, including insects and even small animals, but they mostly eat plants, are very in kinds. Even though they're quite large and powerful, with strong jaws that can crush beetles and snail shells, they still have quite a few predators. Large birds, like cassowaries, were one of the main ones in the past. But nowadays, they're more likely to be caught and killed by snakes. Actually, another threat to their survival isn't a predator at all, but is man-made. Quite a large number of sleepy lizards are killed by cars when they're trying to cross highways. One study carried out by Michael Freak at Flinders University investigated the methods of navigation of these lizards. Though they move slowly, they can travel quite long distances. And he found that even if they were taken some distance away from their home territory, they could usually find their way back home as long as they could see the sky. They didn't need any other landmarks on the ground. Observations of these lizards in the wild have also revealed that their mating habits are quite unusual. Unlike most animals, it seems that they're relatively monogamous, returning to the same partner year after year. And the male and female also stay together for a long time, both before and after the birth of their young. It's quite interesting to think about the possible reasons for this. It could be that it's to do with protecting their young. You'd expect them to have a much better chance of survival if they have both parents around. But in fact, observers have noted that once the babies have hatched out of their eggs, they have hardly any contact with their parents. So there's not really any evidence to support that idea. Another suggestion is based on the observation that male lizards in monogamous relationships tend to be bigger and stronger than other males. So maybe the male lizards stay around so they can give the female lizards protection from other males. But again, we're not really sure. Finally, I'd like to mention another study that involved collecting data by tracking the lizards. I was actually involved in this myself. So we caught some lizards in the wild, and we developed a tiny GPS system that would allow us to track them, and we fixed this onto their tails. Then we set the lizards free again, and we were able to track them for 12 days and gather data, not just about their location, but even about how many steps they took during this period. One surprising thing we discovered from this is that there were far fewer meetings between lizards than we expected. It seems that they were actually trying to avoid one another. So why would that be? Well, again, we have no clear evidence, but one hypothesis is that male lizards can cause quite serious injuries to one another. So maybe this avoidance is a way of preventing this. Of self-preservation, if you like. But we need to collect a lot more data before we can be sure of any of this.",264.67875,151.20216488856778,Fast

ielts-listening-0248-cam4-test-2-part-4.wav,"So far in these lectures we've been looking at crimes like robbery and murder, both from a historical viewpoint, and also in contemporary society, and we've seen that the preoccupation in Western society with crime and with lawlessness is part of a long and continuous tradition, rather than something which is new and unique to modern society. But over the past 70 years or so there has been a massive increase in one type of crime, which is what's known as corporate crime. Corporate crime is crime which, as the name suggests, is connected with companies, with business organizations. It includes illegal acts of either individuals or a group within the company. But what is important is that these acts are normally in accordance with the goals of the company, therefore the good of the company rather than the individual. It's been defined as, quote, crime which is committed for the corporate organization, the company, not against it. Unquote. So crimes like theft by employees, things like embezzlement or fraud against one's actual employer are excluded according to this definition. The employees may be involved, but they're acting in the first place for the company. They may not even realize they're committing a crime, or they may realize, but they feel it's excusable because it's policy, or because otherwise they may lose their jobs. So here really we're talking about the links between power and crime. Now, this is one area that much less is generally known about than conventional or traditional crime. It has been relatively ignored by the mass media. For example, it tends to be under-reported in comparison with conventional crime and news broadcasts, and in crime serials and films and so on. They very rarely deal with corporate crime. And it also tends to be ignored in academic circles. There's been far more research on conventional crime, and far more data is available. There are several reasons for this lack of interest in corporate crime compared with other types of crime. It's often very complex, whereas with conventional crime it's usually possible to follow what's going on without specialist knowledge. As well as this, whereas conventional crime usually has a lot of human interest, corporate crime often has much less. The third reason, and possibly the most significant one, is that very often the victims are unaware. They think their misfortune is an accident, or that it's the fault of no one in particular. They're unaware that they've been victims of a crime. So when we look at the effects of corporate crime, we may find it's very difficult to assess the costs, but these costs can be very considerable in both their economic and social aspects. Let's look at the economic costs first. For example, if a company is producing fruit juice, and it dilutes its product so that it's just a little below the concentration it should be, many millions of people may be paying a small amount extra for their carton of orange juice. Now small amounts like this may seem insignificant for individual customers, too small to worry about, but for the company, this deception might result in massive illegal profit. However, all studies of corporate crime agree that the individuals are in fact deprived of far more money by such crime than they are by conventional crime like robbery and theft. In addition to this, we have to consider the social costs of corporate crime, and these are again very difficult to assess, but they are considerable. They're important because they can undermine the faith of the public in the business world, and also, more importantly, because the main group of people they affect are in fact not the richer sections of society, but the poorer, so here companies are robbing the poor to benefit the rich. There are two more points to do with corporate crime that I'd like to illustrate with reference to a specific event which occurred several years ago. This was an explosion of a large oil tanker, which caused the loss of more than fifty lives of the crew. It was an explosion which never should have happened, and as subsequent inquiry laid the blame not on anyone who had actually been on the tanker at the time, but on the owners of the tanker. They had deliberately decided not to carry out necessary repair work on the tanker as it was due to be sold, and it was this lack of repair work which was directly responsible for the explosion. Now this illustrates two points to do with corporate crime. First of all, that it does not have to be intentional. The owners of the tanker certainly did not intend it to explode, but very serious consequences can result from people or organizations not considering the possible results of their actions seriously enough. The main crime here was indifference to the human results rather than actual intention to harm anyone, but that didn't make the results any less tragic. And this leaves me to my second point. That corporate crime can have very severe consequences. It's not just a matter of companies making bigger profits than they should do, but of events which may affect the lives of innocent people. And yet very often, companies because they say they didn't intend to harm anyone can avoid taking responsibility for the results of their actions, and that has been a very dangerous loophole in the law. Now a further example of corporate crime was that...",373.20975,147.74533623518678,Ideal

short-stories-0200-201-samuel-clemens-or-mark-twain.wav,"Samuel Clemens, or Mark Twain. Mark Twain was the author of some of the greatest works of American English literature, such as Tom Sawyer, Life on the Mississippi, and the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Mark Twain's real name was Samuel Langhorne Clemens. He used Mark Twain as his pen name. Samuel Clemens was born in the American State of Missouri in 1835. As a child, he enjoyed many outdoor activities, such as swimming and fishing. When Samuel was 11 years old, his father died, and he began working to help support his family. As a young man, Samuel Clemens began to write stories for newspapers. However, he took a job working as a navigator on the steamboats that traveled up and down the Mississippi River. Clemens greatly enjoyed this period of his life, during which time he gained much knowledge about life on the river. He also learned much about human behavior by observing the many people on the boats and along the river. It was as a result of this time that Clemens began using his pen name, Mark Twain. This name is taken from a term that was used by the men who worked on the river. It is used to describe water that is just deep enough to be navigated safely. The earliest of Mark Twain's really famous novels was The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. This novel describes a boy who engages in much mischief, but who has a kind heart. This story contains several scenes that are quite funny. In one of these, Tom's working at the boring task of painting a fence. He persuades several other boys to help him by pretending that painting the fence is a fun and enjoyable activity. Another famous novel by Mark Twain was Life on the Mississippi. This book describes many interesting characters similar to those that Twain actually observed while working on a steamboat. This story gives the reader a vivid image of the people who lived and worked along the Mississippi River. Probably the best novel by Mark Twain was The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. This novel tells the story of a boy who runs away from his violent father. The boy, whose name is Huckleberry Finn, is joined in his escape by a man named Jim. Jim is a slave who has decided to run away from his owners. Huck and Jim travel north along the Mississippi, hoping to reach the areas where slavery is not allowed. In this story, the reader can experience the moral sense of Huckleberry, who must make several important decisions during the escape. Mark Twain died in 1910, after writing many more novels and many stories of his travels around the world. Twain's works are still widely read today. His books are appreciated for their humor, for their interest and descriptions of life in 19th century America, and for showing both the good and evil that people can do. Many critics consider Twain to have been the greatest American writer.",199.4188125,150.1362866655321,Fast

Families look for activities to keep the children amused. Although not all workers get a full two months of holidays, most people take a holiday in the summer. The summer begins with a national holiday. In Canada, July 1 is Canada Day. In the USA, July 4 is Independence Day. A lot of families are soon on the road. Some travel to cottages by the lake, some go sightseeing or camping. In Canada, especially, the summers are short, so people try to make the most of them. In much of Canada and parts of the northern USA are woodlands dotted with lakes. These regions of rocks, rivers, pine trees and wild animals are not usually suitable for farming. However, they are ideal places to spend a summer holiday. They are far from the cities. The woods are quiet and peaceful. People fish, go boating or swimming, have barbecues outside or play outdoor sports. Some people spend their whole summer at the cottage. Others go for a week or two. City people who don't have a cottage like to go to parks and swimming pools in the city. If they are near a lake or ocean, they may go there for the day. Many museums, libraries and art galleries have programs for children in the summer. Swimming is probably the favorite summer sport. It feels wonderful on a very hot day to jump into the cool water. Swimming is also excellent exercise. Besides swimming, baseball and football are also popular in the summer. Spending an afternoon or evening at a baseball game is a favorite summer pastime. Summer is also a favorite time to catch up on reading. Stories of adventures and love novels are favorite light reading. But summer is especially a time for traveling across the country. Some people have a camper or trailer that they can live in. Some stay in campgrounds and sleep in tents. Others stay at hotels or motels, while others rent cottages or cabins for a week or two. Most trips are by car. Many people visit national parks and other wildlife areas. Of course, trips along the ocean and the lakes are favorites. Along the Atlantic Ocean, the coasts of New England and Canada's maritime provinces are especially popular. On the Pacific coast, tourists travel from California all the way up to Alaska. Boat cruises along the shores of British Columbia and Alaska are especially popular. Of course, some people find it most relaxing just to stay at home. Others cannot afford to travel. If you have an air conditioned house with a television, video player, CD player and computer, it can be very pleasant to stay at home. A lot of new movies are released at the theaters in the summer. Air conditioned theaters with new movies and lots of pop and popcorn are favorite summer places. After two months of summer activities, most people are ready to go back to school and work.

ielts-listening-0088-cam14-test-2-part-4.wav,"In this series of lectures about the history of weather forecasting, I'll start by examining its early history. That'll be the subject of today's talk. OK, so we'll start by going back thousands of years. Most ancient cultures had weather gods and weather catastrophes such as floods played an important role in many creation myths. Generally, weather was attributed to the whims of the gods, as the wide range of weather gods in various cultures shows. For instance, there's the Egyptian sun god Ra and Thor, the Norse god of thunder and lightning. Many ancient civilizations developed rights such as dances in order to make the weather gods look kindly on them. But the weather was of daily importance, observing the skies and drawing the correct conclusions from these observations was really important. In fact, their survival depended on it. It isn't known when people first started to observe the skies, but at around 650 BC the Babylonians produced the first short-range weather forecasts based on their observations of clouds and other phenomena. The Chinese also recognized weather patterns, and by 300 BC astronomers had developed a calendar which divided the year into 24 festivals, each associated with a different weather phenomenon. The ancient Greeks were the first to develop a more scientific approach to explaining the weather. The work of the philosopher and scientist Aristotle in the fourth century BC is especially note-worthy, as his ideas held sway for nearly 2,000 years. In 340 BC he wrote a book in which he attempted to account for the formation of rain, clouds, wind and storms. He also described celestial phenomena such as halos, that is bright circles of light around the sun, the moon and bright stars, and comets. Many of his observations were surprisingly accurate. For example, he believed that heat could cause water to evaporate, but he also jumped to quite a few wrong conclusions, such as that winds are breathed out by the earth. Errors like this were rectified from the Renaissance onwards. For nearly 2,000 years Aristotle's work was accepted as the chief authority on weather theory. Alongside this though, in the Middle Ages, weather observations were passed on in the form of proverbs, such as red sky at night, shepherds delight, red sky in the morning, shepherds warning. Many of these are based on very good observations and are accurate, as contemporary meteorologists have discovered. For centuries any attempt to forecast the weather could only be based on personal observations, but in the 15th century scientists began to see the need for instruments. Until then, the only ones available were weather veins, to determine the wind direction and early versions of rain gauges. One of the first invented in the 15th century was a high grometer, which measured humidity. This was one of many inventions that contributed to the development of weather forecasting. In 1592, the Italian scientist and inventor Galileo developed the world's first thermometer. His student, Toricelli, later invented the barometer, which allowed people to measure atmospheric pressure. In 1648, the French philosopher Pascal proved that pressure decreases with altitude. This discovery was verified by English astronomer Halle in 1686, and Halle was also the first person to map trade winds. This increasing ability to measure factors related to weather helped scientists to understand the atmosphere and its processes better, and they started collecting weather observation data systematically. In the 18th century, the scientist and politician Benjamin Franklin carried out work on electricity and lightning in particular, but he was also very interested in weather and studied it throughout most of his life. It was Franklin who discovered that storms generally travel from west to east. In addition to new meteorological instruments, other developments contributed to our understanding of the atmosphere. People in different locations began to keep records, and in the mid-19th century, the invention of the telegraph made it possible for these records to be collated. This led, by the end of the 19th century, to the first weather services. It was not until the early 20th century that mathematics and physics became part of meteorology, and we'll continue from that point next week.",381.66825,108.94277949501956,Ideal

ielts-listening-0252-cam4-test-3-part-4.wav,"We're very grateful that the committee has agreed that a representative for the students union can present students' suggestions about the design for the proposed new union building. We appreciate that some of our ideas may not be feasible in the circumstances, but we do feel that it is important that the ultimate beneficiaries of the facilities should have some say in its design. If I could start by briefly explaining what steps were taken to find out student opinion and how we have arrived at conclusions. Firstly, a meeting was held in the current union for our SU committee to explain the options. Then we invited all students to submit written suggestions for the design, placing cards in a suggestion box. These suggestions then provided the basis for the design of a questionnaire which was completed by approximately 2,000 of the college students over a period of three weeks. Finally, the SU committee collated the results and drew up a report. If I can just hand around a copy of that report, this presentation is essentially a summary and discussion of the key points of this report. So in broad terms, the consensus was as follows. Firstly, regarding the crucial matter of the site, we presented the three options that you have proposed. One, in the city center near the faculty of education, two, on the outskirts of the city near the park, and three out of town near the halls of residence. We asked students to cite reasons for and against these sites and there was remarkable agreement on all three. Site one was unpopular because of traffic and parking problems. Site two had a number of supporters, mainly because it was close to most lecture rooms, and Site three out of town near the halls of residence was clearly the most popular because of access from living quarters. It was clear that the union was mainly to be used after lectures. It was also felt that the larger site would allow more room for a choice of facilities. Our second area of interest was obviously the facilities. There was minimal interest in having a library on the premises, but one option seemed to be a reading room instead, more useful. We would like the current table games room to be replaced with a small gym, and if possible, a small swimming pool, not, of course, Olympic sized. There was a large number of respondents in favor of a travel agent's and insurance center. We also requested there be the offices of the student counseling center moving this from the refectery. There was, however, much disagreement about whether to build a drama theater. Just over 40% of the respondents were in favor, but a large minority were strongly against it, claiming that it is elitist and a waste of funds. Essentially, the jury is out on that. Finally, given the number of unfortunate incidents in the current union over the past few months, a strong point was repeatedly made about security. The recommendations would be that at least video surveillance and security personnel who would check student union cards on request. We doubt if it would be feasible to have a check at reception of all people coming in. Well, this is the summary of the views of the student population.

short-stories-0240-242-the-welland-canal.wav,"The Welland Canal. Before railways and automobiles became common, transporting goods over long distances was a difficult chore. An early North America roads were often bad or nonexistent. In the winter, snow and cold weather made travel difficult. Frontier farmers had trouble selling their crops because it was hard to get them to the cities. Often rivers and lakes were the best ways to travel. Fur traders carried their furs and other supplies in canoes. But even large canoes were not big enough to hold a shipment of wheat. Rapids and waterfalls meant that goods had to be taken out of the canoe and carried to the next body of calm water. One way to improve water transportation was to build a canal. In New York State, Governor DeWitt Clinton had constructed the Erie Canal from the Niagara River to the Hudson River, soon after the War of 1812. Because relations between the United States and Canada were still not very friendly, this was another reason to build a canal on the Canadian side. Canals could be used to move supplies and troops during wartime. Sometimes the British government would forbid Canadian farmers to sell food to the USA. Without a canal to move their farm produce, crops were sometimes left to rot. A St. Catherine's Ontario merchant named William Hamilton Merritt thought about all these things in the 1820s. He also thought that flower mills needed a more reliable source of water to operate. St. Catherine's is on 12 mile creek below the Niagara escarpment. This creek runs towards Lake Ontario. It rises above the escarpment which stands from 150 to 300 feet high, then runs towards Lake Ontario. If Merritt could join the 12 mile creek to one of the rivers which ran to Lake Erie, the canal would provide transportation and water power. The problem was to find a way to move boats up the escarpment. From 1824 to 1829, Merritt and his friends hired laborers to dig away tons of dirt and rock. Nearly all the work was done with shovels, pickaxes, horses, and wagons. In places the ground was soft and landslides occurred. In other places, the men had to dig through solid granite rock. Merritt's main problem, however, was raising the money to pay for the construction. After sinking all the money that he, his family, and friends had into the canal more was needed. Merritt went to Toronto, New York, and finally London England to get the financial support he needed. The problem of getting the boats to climb the escarpment was solved by a series of 35 wooden locks. These carried a ship 327 feet upwards. The ship would enter a lock with a small amount of water. More water would come into the lock, lifting the boat another 10 or 15 feet. Then the ship would move into the next lock and be lifted up again. Boats going in the opposite direction were lowered instead of lifted. The Waland Canal has been rebuilt three times since the first canal opened in 1829. Now large sea going and lake vessels cross the Niagara Peninsula from Lake Ontario to Lake Erie. They carry grain, coal, iron ore, oil, and many other bulk products. The Waland Canal remains one of the most important commercial waterways in the world.",207.908625,159.87792714227223,Fast
ielts-listening-0140-cam11-test-3-part-4.wav,"So, what I'm going to talk about to you today is something called ethnography. This is a type of research aimed at exploring the way human cultures work. It was first developed for use in anthropology, and it's also been used in sociology and communication studies. So, what's it got to do with business, you may ask? Well, businesses are finding that ethnography can offer them deeper insight into the possible needs of customers, either present or future, as well as providing valuable information about their attitudes towards existing products. And ethnography can also help companies to design new products or services that customers really want. Let's look at some examples of how ethnographic research works in business. One team of researchers did a project for a company manufacturing kitchen equipment. They watched how cooks used measuring cups to measure out things like sugar and flour. They saw that the cooks had to check and recheck the contents, because although the measuring cups had numbers inside them, the cooks couldn't see these easily. So, a new design of cup was developed to overcome this problem, and it was a topseller. Another team of ethnographic researchers looked at how cell phones were used in Uganda, in Africa. They found that people who didn't have their own phones could pay to use the phones of local entrepreneurs. Because these customers paid in advance for their calls, they were eager to know how much time they'd spent on the call so far. So, the phone company designed phones for use globally with this added feature. Ethnographic research has also been carried out in computer companies. In one company, IT systems administrators were observed for several weeks. It was found that a large amount of their work involved communicating with colleagues in order to solve problems, but that they didn't have a standard way of exchanging information from spreadsheets and so on. So, the team came up with an idea for software that would help them to do this. In another piece of research, a team observed and talked to nurses working in hospitals. This led to the recognition that the nurses needed to access the computer records of their patients no matter where they were. This led to the development of a portable computer tablet that allowed the nurses to check records in locations throughout the hospital. Occasionally, research can be done even in environments where the researchers can't be present. For example, in one project done for an airline, respondents used their smartphones to record information during airline trips, in a study aiming at tracking the emotions of passengers during a flight. So, what makes studies like these different from ordinary research? Let's look at some of the general principles behind ethnographic research in business. First of all, the researcher has to be completely open-minded. He or she hasn't thought a hypothesis to be tested as is the case in other types of research. Instead, they wait for the participants in the research to inform them. As far as choosing the participants themselves is concerned, that's not really all that different from ordinary research. The criteria, according to which the participants are chosen, may be something as simple as the age bracket they fall into, or the researchers may select them according to their income, or they might try to find a set of people who all use a particular product, for example. But it's absolutely crucial to recruit the right people as participants. As well as the criteria I've mentioned, they have to be comfortable talking about themselves and being watched as they go about their activities. Actually, most researchers say that people open up pretty easily, maybe because they're often in their own home or workplace. So, what makes this type of research special is that it's not just a matter of sending a questionnaire to the participants. Instead, the research is usually based on first-hand observation of what they're doing at the time. But that doesn't mean that the researcher never talks to the participants. However, unlike in traditional research, in this case, it's the participant rather than the researchers who decides what direction the interview will follow. This means that there's less likelihood of the researcher imposing his or her own ideas on the participant. But after they've said goodbye to their participants and got back to their office, the researchers' work isn't finished. Most researchers estimate that 70 to 80% of their time is spent not on the collecting of data, but on its analysis, looking at photos, listening to recordings and transcribing them and so on. The researchers may end up with hundreds of pages of notes, and to determine what significant they don't focus on the sensational things or the unusual things. Instead, they try to identify a pattern of some sort in all this data and to discern the meaning behind it. This can result in some compelling insights that can in turn feed back to the whole design process.",353.1939375,142.01829271205992,Ideal
ielts-listening-0100-cam13-test-1-part-4.wav,"Hi! Today we're going to be looking at animals in urban environments, and I'm going to be telling you about some research on how they're affected by these environments. Now, in evolutionary terms, urban environments represent huge upheavals, the sorts of massive changes that usually happen over millions of years. And we used to think that only a few species could adapt to this new environment. One species, which is well known as being highly adaptable, is the crow, and there have been various studies about how they manage to learn new skills. Another successful species is the pigeon, because they're able to perch on ledges on the walls of city buildings, just like they once perched on cliffs by the sea. But in fact, we're now finding that these early immigrants were just the start of a more general movement of animals into cities, and of adaptation by these animals to city life. And one thing that researchers are finding, especially interesting, is the speed with which they're doing this. We're not talking about gradual evolution here. These animals are changing fast. Let me tell you about some of the studies that have been carried out in this area. So in the University of Minnesota, a biologist called Emily Snellrude and her colleagues looked at specimens of urbanized small mammals, such as mice and gophers, that had been collected in Minnesota, and that are now kept in museums there. And she looked at specimens that had been collected over the last hundred years, which is a very short time in evolutionary terms. And she found that during that time, these small mammals had experienced a jump in brain size when compared to rural mammals. Now we can't be sure this means they're more intelligent, but since the sizes of other parts of the body didn't change, it does suggest that something cognitive was going on. And Snellrude thinks that this change might reflect the cognitive demands of adjusting to city life, having to look in different places to find food, for example, and coping with a whole new set of dangers. Then over in Germany, at the Max Planck Institute, there's another biologist called Katharina Miranda, who's done some experiments with blackbirds living in urban and rural areas. And she's been looking not at their anatomy, but at their behavior. So as you might expect, she's found that the urban blackbirds tend to be quite bold. They're prepared to face up to a lot of threats that would frighten away their country counterparts. But there's one type of situation that does seem to frighten the urban blackbirds, and that's anything new, anything they haven't experienced before. And if you think about it, that's quite sensible for a bird living in the city. Jonathan Atwell, in Indiana University, is looking at how a range of animals respond to urban environments. He's found that when they're under stress, their endocrine systems react by reducing the amount of hormones such as corticosterone into their blood. It's a sensible seeming adaptation. A rat that gets scared every time a subway train rolls past won't be very successful. There's just one more study I'd like to mention, which is by Sarah Parton and her team. And they've been looking at how squirrels communicate in an urban environment, and they've found that a routine part of their communication is carried out by waving their tails. You do also see this in the country, but it's much more prevalent in cities, possibly because it's effective in a noisy environment. So what are the long-term implications of this? One possibility is that we may see completely new species developing in cities. But on the other hand, it's possible that not all of these adaptations will be permanent. Once the animals got accustomed to its new environment, it may no longer need the features it's developed. So now we've had a look at adaptation.",284.9663125,138.1215893720771,Ideal

ielts-listening-0102-cam13-test-2-part-2.wav,"Thanks for coming everyone. Okay, so this meeting is for a new staff and staff who haven't been involved with our volunteering projects yet. So basically, the idea is that we allow staff to give up some of their work time to help on various charity projects to benefit the local community. We've been doing this for the last five years and it's been very successful. Participating doesn't necessarily involve a huge time commitment. The company will pay for eight hours of your time. That can be used over one or two days, all at once, or spread over several months throughout the year. There are some staff who enjoy volunteering so much, they also give up their own free time for a couple of hours every week. It's completely up to you. Obviously, many people will have family commitments and aren't as available as other members of staff. Feedback from staff has been overwhelmingly positive because they felt they were doing something really useful, nearly everyone agreed that volunteering made them feel more motivated at work. They also liked building relationships with the people in the local community and felt valued by them. One or two people also said it was a good thing to have on their CVs. One particularly successful project last year was the Get Working Project. This was aimed at helping unemployed people in the area get back to work. Our staff were able to help them improve their telephone skills, such as writing down messages and speaking with confidence to potential customers, which they had found quite difficult. This is something many employers look for in job applicants and something we all do without even thinking about every day at work. We've got an exciting new project starting this year. Up until now we've mainly focused on projects to do with education and training, and we'll continue with our reading project in schools and our work with local charities. But we've also agreed to help out on a conservation project in Redfern Park. So if any of you fancy being outside and getting your hands dirty, this is the project for you. I also wanted to mention the annual Digital Inclusion Day, which is coming up next month. The aim of this is to help older people keep up with technology, and this year, instead of hosting the event in our own training facility, we're using the ICT Suite at Hill College, as it can hold far more people. We've invited over 60 people from the Silver Age Community Center to take part, so we'll need a lot of volunteers to help with this event. If you're interested in taking part, please go to the volunteering section of our website and complete the relevant form. We won't be providing any training for this, but you'll be paired with an experienced volunteer if you've never done it before. By the way, don't forget to tell your manager about any volunteering activities you decide to do. The participants on the Digital Inclusion Day really benefited. The majority were in their 70s, though some were younger, and a few were even in their 90s. Quite a few owned both a computer and a mobile phone, but these tended to be outdated models. They generally knew how to do simple things like send texts, but weren't aware of recent developments in mobile phone technology. A few were keen to learn, but most were quite dismissive at first. They couldn't see the point of updating their skills, but that soon changed. The feedback was very positive. The really encouraging thing was that participants all said they felt much more confident about using social media to keep in touch with their grandchildren, who prefer this form of communication to phoning or sending emails. A lot of them also said playing online games would help them make new friends and keep their brains active. They weren't that impressed with being able to order their groceries online as they liked going out to the shops, but some said it would come in handy if they were ill or the weather was really bad. One thing they asked about was using tablets for things like reading newspapers. Some people had been given tablets as presents, but had never used them.

short-stories-0198-199-chicago.wav,"Chicago. Chicago is one of the most famous American cities. Some cities in the United States, such as New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, may be more glamorous, but many people agree that Chicago is the city that best represents the United States. Located in the middle of North America, Chicago has derived much benefit from its geography. The city's central location has made its O'Hara International Airport the hub for most airlines in the United States. Its location on the shores of Lake Michigan has made it a major port and business center where the agricultural and industrial products of the American Midwest are shipped overseas. Until about the 1830s, Chicago was a minor trading post, but then it grew rapidly as the most important town in the rapidly developing areas of the Midwestern United States. In 1871, the city was destroyed by a fire. It is often said that the fire started when a cow knocked over an oil lamp. It took about 20 years for the city to be completely rebuilt, but it continued to expand. In 1882, the first skyscraper was built in Chicago. Around the turn of the century, the population of Chicago was growing quickly. Many African-American people moved to Chicago from the Southern United States, and many immigrants from Eastern Europe also arrived in Chicago during this time. Because of the busy and active atmosphere of the city, an American poet described Chicago as the city of broad shoulders. Chicago became notorious for organized crime during the prohibition era of the 1920s, when the sale of alcohol was illegal. Mobsters such as Al Capone became rich by smuggling liquor, and many people were killed in conflicts between rival gangs of criminals. But the influence of organized crime later became weaker. In the decades following World War II, Chicago experienced some problems with crime, property, and racial conflict. However, the city has recently prospered, and social conditions have improved from many people in Chicago. Compared with other large cities, Chicago is viewed as an affordable place to live, with a high quality of life. The city has a fish and transportation, and many beautiful parks along the Lake Michigan Shoreline. Chicago is famous for its many attractions, including the Art Institute of Chicago, the Field Museum of Natural History, the Shad Aquarium, the Sears Tower, and the Miracle Mile Shopping District. Indeed, Chicago is one of the most interesting cities in the United States.",176.743875,139.52392975428427,Ideal
ielts-listening-0032-cam18-test-4-part-4.wav,"The person I've chosen to talk about is the French writer Victor Hugo. Many people have heard of him because his novel, Les Miserables, which he wrote in 1862, is famous around the world. It became a stage musical in the 1980s and a film version was also released in 2012. So some of us, I'm sure, have a pretty general idea of the plot, but we know much less about the author. Today I'm going to provide a little more insight into this talented man, and I'm going to talk particularly about the home he had on the island of Guernsey in the British Channel Islands. But first, his early career. As I've said, he was a writer. He was at the height of his career in Paris, and he was very highly regarded by his colleagues. As far as literature was concerned, he was the leading figure of the romantic movement. However, as well as being a literary genius, he also gave many speeches about issues like the level of poverty in his society. He felt very strongly about this, and about other areas where change was needed, like education. This kind of outspoken criticism was not well liked by the rulers of France, and eventually the Emperor, Napoleon III, told Victor Hugo to leave Paris and not return. In other words, he sent him into exile. So Victor Hugo was forced to reside in other parts of Europe. Guernsey was actually his third place of exile, and he landed there in 1855. He produced a lot while on Guernsey, including Les Miserables, and to do this, he had to spend a great deal of time in the home that he had there. This was a property that he bought using the money he'd made in France from the publication of a collection of his poetry. It was the only property he ever owned. And he was very proud of it. The property Victor Hugo bought on Guernsey was a large five-story house in the capital town of St. Peterport, and he lived there for 15 years, returning to France in 1870, when Napoleon's empire collapsed. He decorated and furnished each level or floor of the house in unique and wonderful ways, and many people considered the inside of the house to be a work of art. Today it's a museum that attracts 200,000 visitors a year. He lived in the house with his family, and portraits of its members still hang in rooms on the ground floor, along with drawings that he did during his travels that he felt were important to him. In other ground floor rooms, there are huge tapestries that he would have designed and loved. The walls are covered in darkwood paneling that Victor Hugo created himself using wooden furniture that he bought in the market. The items were relatively inexpensive, and he used them to create intricate carvings. They gave an atmosphere on the lower level that was shadowy and rather solemn. On the next level of the house there are two impressive lounges where he entertained his guests. One lounge has entirely red furnishings, such as sofas and wall coverings, and the other blue. There's a strong Chinese influence in these areas in things like the wall paper pattern and the lamps, which he would have made himself by copying original versions. His library, where he left many of his favourite books, forms the hallway to the third floor, and was a comfortable area where he could relax and enjoy his afternoons. And then, at the very top of the house, there's a room called the Lookout. Called that because it looks out over the harbour. In contrast to the rather dark lower levels, it's full of light and was like a glass office where he would write until lunchtime, often at his desk. So Victor Hugo was a man of many talents, but he was also true to his values. While living in his house on Guernsey, he entertained many other famous writers, but he also invited a large group of local children from the deprived areas of the island to dinner once a week. What's more, he served them their food, which was an extraordinary gesture for the time period. In 1927, the house was owned by his relatives, and they decided to donate it to the city of Paris. It has since been restored using photographs from the period, and, as I mentioned earlier, is now a museum that is open to the public.",337.94975,134.2211379058573,Ideal
short-stories-0176-177-the-inuit.wav,"The Inuit Not many people would want to live in the Arctic areas of Northern Canada, Alaska, and Greenland. In these places, the summers are very short, and the winters are extremely cold and dark. However, there are some people who have made this land their home for many generations. These people are called the Inuit. The word Inuit means person in the language of the Inuit, which is called inactotet. Before modern times, the Inuit had to survive by hunting. Because their homeland was in such a cold, northern place, the Inuit could not make a living by farming or by gathering plants. Many of the animals that the Inuit hunted are mammals that live in the water. For example, the Inuit used boats to hunt whales. Also, they hunted seals by waiting for the seals to rise to the surface of the water. Sometimes, the Inuit would hunt land mammals, such as polar bears. When eating the meat of the animals that they hunted, the Inuit often ate the meat raw. This was necessary because only raw meat could provide them with enough nutrients to survive in a place where fruits and vegetables were not available. In previous times, the Inuit were known as the Eskimos, which means people who eat raw meat. However, the Inuit did not like this name. The Inuit invented many useful tools for surviving in the cold, northern areas. They sowed warm clothing from the furs and skins of the animals they hunted. For transportation, they used dogs, which could pull them in sleds across the snow. For making heat and light, they used lamps that burned the fat and oil of whales. The Inuit were famous for their houses made of snow, which were called igloos. The igloos were made by cutting blocks of snow and then using these blocks to build a small round-shaped house. People could enter or exit the igloo through a narrow tunnel. In recent decades, the Inuit have had much contact with the modern world. Inuit children now attend schools and Inuit adults work at a variety of occupations. In some ways, the Inuit have found it difficult to adjust to the changes from their traditional ways, but the Inuit are meeting this challenge. In Canada, there is a new territory in the far north called Nunevut, where most of the people, including the leaders, are Inuit. The Inuit are famous for their beautiful artwork. In particular, Inuit carvings or sculptures are known for their excellent quality. These carvings, which nowadays are made from a kind of stone, called soapstone, depict people or animals such as bears, seals, or whales. In addition to paintings, Inuit artists have produced beautiful sketches and paintings of northern scenes.",191.111875,143.79012293192142,Ideal

short-stories-0273-276-sunday-morning-at-church.wav,"Sunday morning at church. Every Sunday is a holiday or half holiday in North America. Some stores may be open, but banks, offices, and government services are usually closed. Sunday closing has a Christian origin. Christians believe that Jesus Christ rose from the dead on a Sunday morning, so Sunday is known as the Lord's Day. About 30 or 35% of North Americans attend church regularly on Sunday mornings. The same percentage attend church occasionally. At Christmas and Easter, the churches are very full as people celebrate these two important holy days. Nearly everybody goes to church at least three times. They are baptized or dedicated as a child. Most people are married in a church, and many people are buried after a church service. Church services are usually held Sunday mornings, often at 11 o'clock a.m., although there may also be evening services provided. The services last an hour, their purpose is to worship God and to help people focus on religious and moral beliefs. The service is led by a pastor, minister, or priest, who usually also looks after the people and the business of the church. It is the pastor who delivers the sermon at 20 minutes talk on a religious or moral matter. Usually members take part in the service. They may lead the singing, read from the Bible, offer prayers for the congregation, take of the collection, or act as ushers. Most churches also have a choir, a group of singers who lead in singing the hymns. There are many cultural traditions connected to going to church. People normally wear their best clothing and try to be on their best behavior. Talking or making noise in churches is usually considered bad. This is why children often have a separate children's church, or Sunday school, where they can be more like children. The Sunday service is the main weekly event at many churches, but nowadays there are growing number of large super churches which organize all kinds of activities for their members. These churches usually have large buildings and a large staff to plan and lead various activities. These might include prayer group, counseling and social work, youth programs, social action, fundraising events, etc. Many large churches have gymnasiums for regular sports activities. At the same time, host churches are also becoming very popular. These are small groups of people who meet at private homes. Sometimes a group will meet in a house until they have the money to buy a church, but many people say they prefer to meet in small groups, that way they get to know one another better. Then they feel comfortable sharing their problems and successes and praying for each other. Some say that large churches can interfere with getting close to God and other Christians. There are many different brands of Christianity. The largest single denomination in North America is Roman Catholicism. Some large Christian brands are Episcopalian, Methodist, Baptist, Pentecostal, Lutheran and Presbyterian. I'll have slightly different traditions and beliefs.

ielts-listening-0096-cam14-test-4-part-4.wav,"In today's class, I'm going to talk about marine archaeology, the branch of archaeology focusing on human interaction with the sea, lakes and rivers. It's the study of ships, cargoes, shipping facilities and other physical remains. I'll give you an example. Then go on to show how this type of research is being transformed by the use of the latest technology. Atlit Yam was a village on the coast of the eastern Mediterranean, which seems to have been thriving until around 7,000 BC. The residents kept cattle, caught fish and stored grain. They had wells for fresh water. Many of their houses were built around a courtyard and were constructed of stone. The village contained an impressive monument, seven half-tonne stones standing in a semicircle around a spring that might have been used for ceremonial purposes. Atlit Yam may have been destroyed swiftly by a tsunami, or climate change may have caused glaciers to melt and sea levels to rise, flooding the village gradually. Over the cause, it now lies ten metres below the surface of the Mediterranean, buried under sand at the bottom of the sea. It's been described as the largest and best preserved prehistoric settlement ever found on the sea bed. For marine archaeologists, atlit Yam is a treasure trove. Watch on the buildings, tools and the human remains has revealed how the bustling village once functioned, and even what diseases some of its residents suffered from. But of course, this is only one small village, one window into a lost world. For a fuller picture, researchers need more sunken settlements, but the hard part is finding them. Underwater research used to require divers to find shipwrecks or artifacts, but in the second half of the 20th century, various types of underwater vehicles were developed, some controlled from a ship on the surface, and some of them autonomous, which means they don't need to be operated by a person. This underwater vehicles, or AUVs, are used in the oil industry, for instance, to create maps of the sea bed, before rigs and pipelines are installed. To navigate, they use sensors such as compasses and sonar. Until relatively recently they were very expensive, and so heavy that they had to be launched from a large vessel with a winch. But the latest AUVs are much easier to maneuver. They can be launched from the shore or a small ship, and they're much cheaper, which makes them more accessible to research teams. They're also very sophisticated. They can communicate with each other, and, for example, work out the most efficient way to survey a site, or to find particular objects on the sea bed. Field tests show the approach can work. For example, in a trial in 2015, three AUVs searched for wrecks at Marcy Mememi off the coast of Sicily. The site is the final resting place of an ancient Roman ship, which sank in the 6th century AD, while ferrying prefabricated marble elements for the construction of an early church. The AUVs mapped the area in detail, finding other ships carrying columns of the same material. Creating an internet in the sea for AUVs to communicate is no easy matter. Wi-Fi networks on land use electromagnetic waves, but in water these will only travel a few centimeters. Instead, a more complex mix of technologies is required. For short distances, AUVs can share data using light, while acoustic waves are used to communicate over long distances. But more creative solutions are also being developed, where an AUV working on the sea bed offloads data to a second AUV, which then surfaces and beams the data home to the research team using a satellite. There's also a system that enables AUVs to share information from sea bed scans and other data. So, if an AUVs surveying the sea bed finds an intriguing object, it can share the coordinates of the object, that is, its position, with a nearby AUV that carries superior cameras, and arrange for that AUV to make a closer inspection of the object. Marine archaeologists are excited about the huge potential of these AUVs for their discipline. One site where they're going to be deployed is the Gulf of Barathe off the Italian coast. In 1974, a 2000-year-old Roman vessel was discovered here in 18 meters of water. When it sank, it was carrying medical goods in wooden or tin receptacles. This cargo gives us insight into the treatments available all those years ago, including tablets that are thought to have been dissolved to form a cleansing liquid for the eyes. Other Roman ships went down nearby, taking their cargoes with them. Some held huge pots made of terracotta. Some were used for transporting cargoes of olive oil, and others held wine. In many cases, it's only these containers that remain, while the wooden ships have been buried under silt on the sea bed. Another project that's about to be...",422.646625,116.97715556110262,Ideal

Throughout the sessions for LLMs and SLMs, we have come across each of the benefits and limitation as well as to use SLMs over LLMs. And also, generative AI has emerged as a game changer, allowing machines to create original content, enhancing user experience, productivity. So we also examine geoclastering techniques and data analytics methodologies, empowering organizations to make precise data-driven decisions and ethical considerations, particularly AI hallucinations were emphasized. In terms of practical applications, AI transformative impact was evident across sectors like finance, healthcare, and manufacturing. The conference highlighted the complementary roles of machine learning, ML and operational research, or in decision-making. The distinction between this machine learning and operation research was made clearer, showing how these MLs predictive capabilities and ORs optimization techniques complement each other in decision-making processes. And also, future innovations are expected through the integration of AI and emerging technologies like Internet of Teams, IoT, blockchain, and argumentate reality driving automated workflows and enhanced customer interactions. So finally, addressing challenges such as data privacy and scalability remains critical, but interdisciplinary collaboration and continuous AI algorithm innovation promise a bright future for responsible AI development.

ielts-listening-0312-ielts-recent-actual-test-30-part-4.wav,"Good afternoon and welcome to Insect Biology 101. I'd like to begin this course with a few remarks about good insects and bad ones. Bugs are all around us and that's both a benefit and an annoyance. Sometimes maybe even serious harm. First let's talk about the good things that insects do for us. Probably the most important insect for humans and maybe for all other life is the bee. Bees help plants in the process of pollination and thus are necessary to most flowers and fruit producing trees. That is they carry pollen from male flowers to female. If it weren't for bees we'd have very few food plants and no fruit either. In fact there would be no we. No less a thinker than Albert Einstein pointed out that without bees humanity would be dead within a year or less. Weed starve. It's that simple. That should maybe make us just a little humble. A little less dramatic is the fact that bees also make the honey we eat. Moreover they produce beeswax which is useful in candles and is also used as a first rate furniture polish. Sure these may not be vital to our lives but they can serve as reminders of how important bees are. That's the point I keep coming back to in this course. Though in alphanus I should point out the butterflies aid in pollination as well as bees. Now here in Michigan was the worst part of summer. Yep that's right mosquitoes. But I'm talking about helpful insects right? So let's look at the dragonfly first. If there were no dragonflies there would be even more mosquitoes. Dragonflies mainly eat mosquitoes and also a few other insects. Yes that's right. They don't just fly around and they also help to eliminate harmful insects. So the next time you see a dragonfly don't you dare kill it. Now let's talk a little about those harmful insects. Take the mosquitoes I just mentioned as an example. Not so many years ago mosquitoes here in America weren't just annoying. Some were even deadly. They carried malaria and yellow fever. My own ancestor, the Confederate general John Bell Hood, lived through the worst battles of civil war only to die at age 38 from yellow fever. A pest, not a bullet. Well besides the mosquitoes, in summer there is also a kind of insect that never seems tired. Right that is the fly. Before I go on talking I must mention an African fly called the Tsitsi fly which feeds on blood and can cause serious diseases in the people and animals that it bites. Besides it is still a bearer of sleeping sickness which affects around 300,000 people every year in Africa and can be treated only with toxic drugs that are hard to administer. Worse still the drugs sometimes don't work. Other insects of course destroy food crops. In China for instance locusts continue to be a danger to the harvest in some areas. Less important but still annoying moths eat people's clothes and dust might slowly destroy carpets. Worse but still in the home termites or white ants eat wood, the wood of your house. If they are not stopped they can eventually destroy the whole building. Usually they seriously damage a building before anyone even notices them. So as we all know insects can be a real trouble. So what to do? You can go ahead and start killing harmful insects. In the early decades after the communist revolution in China, Chairman Mao encouraged the people to swat every fly they could see. Slogans on the walls of buildings called them little capitalists. But fly has reproduced too quickly for this to be a long term solution. For some decades in the west to kill insects with chemicals seemed a good remedy. Unfortunately chemicals can only be used in a limited area for a limited time. It's a small scale solution. The insects come back. Worse still some of the poisons used like DDT were found harmful to the environment. Many kinds of wildlife like hawks were harmed. And people in chemical using rural areas have one of the highest rates of liver cancer in the world. It's no secret that chemicals remain harmful to humans. Like all species, insects adapt to their changing environments at an amazing rate. When a new chemical is introduced to their habitat, the insects that survive are generally the ones with some way of resisting the harmful effects. They then breed with the other survivors, and just like that, insects become resistant to most poison in a few generations. An insect generation, remember, is a couple of months at most. So again, we have to ask what to do. Well, there are biological solutions. Some of these are pretty simple. One is destroying the insects habitat. You take away their home or food. Cleaning your kitchen is the best way to prevent roaches. No garbage, no food. Getting rid of marshes and swamps eliminates mosquitoes. Other solutions might include bringing in dragonflies or bats in areas where mosquitoes are many. This is a cheaper alternative to chemicals. Biological methods like this also bring no extra pollution to the environment. But you have to be careful. If you change the environment too much, you might be hurting other forms of life accidentally. One recent method of controlling insect populations involves interrupting their breeding cycle. What does that mean? It means birth control for bugs. Insects are provided with food that makes them unable to reproduce. Since they can't have babies, the population disappears or nearly so. And since no young are born, resistance is not a problem, with no young insects developing increased resistance. Interrupt the life cycle, eliminate the bug. It's clear that we must have an understanding of the life cycle of the insect. At least, that's the plan. We'll go into more detail as the course goes along. Now, I will stop here to see whether you have any questions or not.",407.673,148.50137242348646,Ideal

ielts-listening-0230-cam5-test-2-part-2.wav,"My name is Dan Perman, and I'd like to talk about the work of Pedal Power, a small charity based mainly in the UK. I'll be giving our contact details at the end if anyone would like to find out more about how to support us. But first, how the charity began. I got the idea of exporting bicycles to developing countries while I was in Ecuador. I went there in 1993 just after graduating from university. After three years of studying, I wanted adventure. I loved travelling, so I decided to join a voluntary organisation and was sent to Ecuador to carry out land surveys. The project came to an end after five years, and when I returned to the UK in 1998, I started planning Pedal Power. Where I lived in Ecuador was a very rural area. My neighbour had the only bicycle in the village, whereas everyone else walked everywhere. My neighbour's business was unusually successful, and for years I couldn't understand why. Then I realised having a bike meant he could get where he wanted to go without much trouble. Other local carpenters could only accept jobs in a three kilometre radius, so no matter how skilled they were, they could never do as many jobs as my neighbour. At Pedal Power, we collect secondhand bikes in the UK and send them to some of the poorest regions in the world. When we distribute bikes overseas, we don't give them away for free. We'd like to, but long term that doesn't really help the local economy. The demand for bikes is enormous, which makes them very expensive locally, so we sell them for 5% of the normal price. But in order to continue operating, we need to have a constant supply of bikes which we send out every six months. One example of a town that's received bicycles from Pedal Power is Rivas. It was the first place I send a full container of bicycles to. Most people there now earn a bicycle. The local economy has developed so much you wouldn't recognise it as the same place. In fact, there are more bikes than on the streets of Amsterdam, if you've ever been there. But Pedal Power still needs your help. You may have read about some of our recent problems in the British media. In August 2000, we simply ran out of money. We had containers of bikes ready to send, but no money to pay the bills. It was a terrible situation. We managed to ensure the bikes went out on time, but the other problems carried on for several months. Fortunately, in October 2001, we won an Enterprise Award, which helped us enormously. We invested 15 of the £75,000 prize money to help secure our future. Winning the award helped raise our profile, and the money enabled us to pay all our shipping costs, which represent our greatest expense. Pedal Power changes lives. When someone gets a bicycle from us, they see a 14% increase in their income. We're currently looking to invest in computers so that our office staff can do an even better job. Because of our work, people in a number of countries now have a better standard of living. So far we've provided 46,000 people with bikes, but would like to send more, at least 50,000 by the end of the year. Now there are many ways in which you can support the work of pedal power, not just by taking a bike to a collection in your area. I should also like to say if you do have a bike to donate, it doesn't matter what condition it's in. If we can't repair it, we'll strip it down for spare parts. Of course, to do that we always need tools which are expensive to buy, so we welcome any that you can give. Also, you could help by contacting the voluntary staff at our offices. They'll be able to suggest activities you could organize to bring in funds for us. People do all kinds of things, including of course sponsored bike rides. Also, we're always interested to hear of other places that would benefit from receiving a consignment of bikes, and welcome suggestions from people who've been to developing regions on their travels. We hope that by talking on radio programs like this, we will be able to raise public awareness, which will lead to government organisations also giving us regular, financial support, something that we really need. If you'd like some more information about where to donate an old bicycle, or offer help in other ways, please contact us.",283.2496875,163.7424577917672,Fast
ielts-listening-0224-cam6-test-4-part-4.wav,"Well, most people think that lions only come from Africa, and you would be forgiven for thinking this because in fact most lions do come from Africa, but this hasn't always been the case. If we go back 10,000 years we would find that there were lions roaming vast sections of the globe, but now unfortunately only very small sections of the lion's former habitat remain. My particular interest is Asiatic lions, which are a subspecies of African lions. It's almost 100,000 years since the Asiatic lions split off and developed as a subspecies. At one time the Asiatic lion was living as far west as Greece, and they were found from there in a band that spread east through various countries of the Middle East all the way to India. In museums you can now see Greek coins that have clear images of the Asiatic lion on them. Most of them are dated at around 500 BC. However, Europe saw its last Asiatic lion roaming free 2,000 years ago. Over the next 1900 years the numbers of Asiatic lions in the other areas declined steadily, but it was only in the 19th century that they disappeared from everywhere but India. So, how can you tell an Asiatic lion from an African lion with which you're probably more familiar? Well, in general Asiatic lions are not as big as African lions. The colour is more or less the same but the appearance of the mane is different. That's the hair around the lion's face and neck. The Asiatic lions mane is noticeably shorter than the African lions. Asiatic lions also have a long fold of skin on their undersides, whereas not many African lions have this. Well, I'd like to talk to you now about the girl sanctuary in India. That's where I've just come back from. The sanctuary was established specifically to protect the Asiatic lion. It's 1,450 square kilometres in area and most of it is forest. There are now around 300 Asiatic lions in India and almost all of them are in the sanctuary. But despite living in a sanctuary which makes them safe from hunters, they still face a number of problems that threaten their survival. One of these is the ever present danger of disease. This is what killed more than a third of Africa's Serengeti lions in 1994 and people are fearful that something similar could happen in the girl sanctuary and kill off many of the Asiatic lions there. India's lions are particularly vulnerable because they have a limited gene pool. The reason for this is interesting. It's because all of them are descended from a few dozen lions that were saved by a prince who took a particular interest in them. He was very wealthy and he managed to protect them. Otherwise, they'd probably have died out completely. When you see the Asiatic lion in India, what you sense is enormous vitality. They're very impressive beasts and you would never guess that they had this vulnerability when you look at them. The Asiatic lions don't have the girl sanctuary to themselves I should add. They actually share it with about 2,000 farmers. A significant proportion of the lion's diet is made up of the livestock of these farmers, goats, chickens and so on as much as a third in fact. And they've even been known to attack humans especially in times of drought. One final piece of interesting information. An ancient India, one of the greatest tests of leadership for a man was to fight a lion. Now it seems in modern India it will be a great test to see if the lion can be saved. I'm sure this is something that all of you will share concern for too.",244.586375,154.30131788821024,Fast

short-stories-0231-233-remember-the-alamo.wav,"Remember the Alamo. The first Europeans in the American Southwest were Spanish explorers and conquerors. They were followed by religious orders that set up missions to Christianize the Indians. One of these missions was San Antonio de Valero. It was founded in 1718 in what is now San Antonio, Texas. Later, the mission structure became known as the Alamo. In 1821, Moses Austin had persuaded the Spanish authorities to give him a charter to settle 200,000 acres in Texas. The elder Austin died shortly after this. Five weeks later, his son Stephen Austin traveled to San Antonio to have this charter confirmed by the Spanish governor. In 1822, Austin led 150 settlers into Texas. When Austin learned afterwards that Mexico was now independent of Spain, he journeyed to Mexico City to have his charter reconfirmed. The Mexicans appointed Austin Regional Administrator for his colony. Texas grew rapidly, cotton farming and cattle ranching were profitable and attracted American settlers. By 1830, there were 16,000 Americans in Texas, four times the Spanish Mexican population. Sam Houston had been a successful soldier and politician. He was a friend and supporter of President Andrew Jackson. However, personal problems and political difficulties led him to leave the USA for Texas. Meanwhile, the struggle for control of Mexico had been won in 1833 by Santa Ana. However, the independent thinking of the Texans infuriated Santa Ana. He had Stephen Austin thrown in jail and sent an army into Texas. Austin was released from jail in time to organize the defense of Texas. The Mexican army was besieged inside the Alamo and after fierce fighting, surrendered. The Mexicans were allowed to go home. Sam Houston was now elected the state supreme commander. Not long after this, Santa Ana approached Texas with an army of 6,000 men. Houston decided not to meet Santa Ana in open battle, but to wait for an advantage. He sent frontiersmen Jim Bowie to the Alamo. These orders were to leave San Antonio and destroy the Alamo. When Bowie arrived, however, Texas volunteers were preparing the Alamo for a siege. Bowie and his men pitched in to help. Other volunteers came. The fiery William Travis arrived with 25 men. Then the famous frontiersmen, Davey Crockett, came with a dozen Tennessee sharpshooters. When Santa Ana attacked, there were 183 Americans inside the fort. Santa Ana brought up cannon to bombard the Alamo. As the walls began to crumble, 4,000 Mexicans attacked from all four sides. The Mexicans overcame all resistance because of their large numbers, but they suffered very heavy losses. All the American defenders were killed. While the battle was raging, the Texans back at the colony declared their independence from Mexico. Sam Houston now gathered men to fight the Mexican army. At first he retreated while waiting for a suitable opportunity. When Santa Ana's rapid advance left the bulk of the Mexican army behind, Houston prepared to fight. Santa Ana's advance troops moved into swampy land by the San Jacinto River. Houston's men attacked while the Mexicans were having their midday Ciesta. Their battle cry was, remember the Alamo. The battle was soon over. Many Mexicans were killed, but only a couple of Texans were killed. Santa Ana was a prisoner. Santa Ana readily agreed now to recognize Texas as an independent republic. 90 years later, in 1845, Texas became the 28th state of the USA.",234.840875,144.09757245198477,Ideal

ielts-listening-0304-ielts-recent-actual-test-8-part-4.wav,"Good morning. Today I am going to cover the daunting task of giving a quality speech, a thought that makes most of us cringe. In fact, 90% of all people feel nervous about public speaking, about 10% of whom are described as genuinely terrified. Hopefully when we are finished here today, you all will be in the 10% of the population who do not feel nervous at all. Did you know that lecturers tend to get more nervous if the speech they are giving is an important one? It makes sense, right? You probably wouldn't be nearly as nervous to address your residence hall about the proper use of the recycle and compost bins, as you might be if you were asked to give the graduation speech to your entire 5,000 student class. So what is it that makes some people completely comfortable in front of crowds? Some people think that the ability to give a good speech is a gift that others are simply born with. This is almost never the case. Public speaking can be learned with practice. The first most important thing you can do to improve your confidence in delivering a speech is to prepare a quality speech. Honestly, while the content of your speech is relatively important, the audience will really only remember the last sentence you say. It is a good idea to structure the rest of your speech to lead up to this last point to really drive your message home. This is a good way to ensure that your speech is well organized. Once you are confident in the quality of the speech you have written, the rest is just about your stage presence. Let's go through some do's and don'ts of public speaking. First, you want to command the attention of the room. Do not, I repeat, do not proceed with your speech until the audience is paying attention. Even Martin Luther King, Jr.'s I have a dream speech wouldn't have made any difference in the world without the undivided attention of his audience. To continue with the I have a dream example, one of the reasons that MLK was such an effective orator was his ability to speak with passion and engage with his audience. That sort of charisma does not come from reading straight from paper. Don't get me wrong, it is a good idea to write your main ideas down on a note card, sheet of paper or something, but one factor that will consistently lead to a boring forgettable speech is writing down your entire speech. Do not write your full speech down. If you are constantly reading your paper, you are not making eye contact with your audience and thus failing to really express the feeling that goes with your ideas. I advise you write one or two ideas, so if you suddenly draw a blank, you have something to jog your memory. If you've written a good speech that you believe in, those ideas should be sufficient to keep you on track. Once you have those ideas written down, give your speech a few practice runs in front of the mirror, into your sound recorder on your phone, or with a friend before it comes time to address a crowd. That way you can hear how the ideas come across, make sure there are no abrupt transitions, and find out whether you are talking too fast or too slow. Timing is important. Make sure you time yourself beforehand to see how long your speech is. That is pretty much it. With practice, you'll be able to deliver an expert speech that engages and even maybe inspires your audience. Just remember, speak with emotion. No one wants to listen to someone reading from a script. As I come to a close in my speech, I'll point out that I have employed all of these tips that I have covered. I practiced my speech ahead of time and timed it, and I can even show you my one small index card with just three simple bullets on it. It's as easy as that.",232.4585,177.06386301210756,Fast
short-stories-0223-225-handels-messiah.wav,"Handel's Messiah George Frederick Handel was a native of Germany and spoke with a German accent all his life. Most of that life, however, was spent in London, England. As a young musician, Handel's sponsor was the Elector of Hanover. Later on, when the Elector became King George I of England, he continued to sponsor Handel. The young Handel went to Italy to study opera. Opera had become a very fashionable entertainment for the upper classes. Handel traveled to England in 1711 and made an immediate success with his operas. Queen Anne granted him a royal pension for life in 1713. Because of this initial success, Handel tried to start a permanent opera company in London, but this failed, and Handel lost money. Since operas used full-stage settings with costumes, scenery and props, they were expensive to produce. Handel decided to produce oratorios in which the parts were simply sung without actions. On August 22, 1741, Handel began to work on his oratorio the Messiah. The text was made up of passages from the Bible relating to the birth, life and death of Jesus. Handel worked on it feverishly, missing meals and going without sleep. He finished it twenty-four days later. When he was asked how he felt on completing it, Handel said, I thought I saw all heaven before me and the great God himself. In the fall of 1741, Handel received an invitation from the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland to present operas and concerts there. Handel traveled from London to Dublin with his entire luggage and many of his singers. However, in order to rehearse on the way, he had to hire local people to fill in. As the composer soundly criticized one local singer who failed to meet his standards. Handel was warmly received in Dublin, where his concerts were sold out. Even his rehearsals were considered newsworthy by the local papers. The Messiah was first publicly performed on April 13, 1742. Seven hundred people squeezed into a six hundred-seat theater to hear it. A notice had requested that ladies attend in hoopless skirts and that gentlemen come without their swords. A Dublin paper reported, words are wanting to express the exquisite delight it afforded to the admiring crowded audience. All proceeds were donated to charity, as the church choirs had refused to participate except on those conditions. Handel returned to London in August 1742 and prepared the oratorio for the London stage. The Messiah made its London debut on March 23, 1743, with King George II in the audience. It was during the Halleluia chorus that the King jumped to his feet and so initiated a tradition that has lasted ever since. With such oratories, Handel was able to reestablish his popularity and restore his finances in London. The Messiah continued to be performed. After conducting it on April 6, 1759, the old composer collapsed and had to be carried home. He died eight days later. The Messiah remains Handel's most popular work, combining wonderful music with inspiring religious sentiments. The biblical text speaks of hope and salvation and the music allows the text to soar into angelic songs.",214.4130625,146.35302361767253,Ideal
ielts-listening-0068-cam15-test-1-part-4.wav,"Today, I'm going to talk about the eucalyptus tree. This is a very common tree here in Australia, where it's also sometimes called the gum tree. First, I'm going to talk about why it's important, then I'm going to describe some problems it faces at present. Right, well, the eucalyptus tree is an important tree for lots of reasons. For example, it gives shelter to creatures like birds and bats, and these and other species also depend on it for food, particularly the nectar from its flowers. So, it supports biodiversity. It's useful to us humans too, because we can kill germs with a disinfectant made from oil extracted from eucalyptus leaves. The eucalyptus grows all over Australia, and the trees can live for up to 400 years. So, it's alarming that all across the country, numbers of eucalyptus are falling, because the trees are dying off prematurely. So, what are the reasons for this? One possible reason is disease. As far back as the 1970s, the trees started getting a disease called mandula yellows. The trees' leaves would gradually turn yellow, then the tree would die. It wasn't until 2004 that they found the cause of the problem was lime, or calcium hydroxide, to give it its proper chemical name, which was being used in the construction of roads. The lime was being washed away into the ground, and affecting the roots of the eucalyptus trees nearby. What it was doing was preventing the trees from sucking up the iron they needed for healthy growth. When this was injected back into the affected trees, they immediately recovered. But this problem only affected a relatively small number of trees. By 2000, huge numbers of eucalyptus were dying along Australia's east coast, of a disease known as Bellminer associated dieback. The Bellminer is a bird, and the disease seems to be common where there are high populations of Bell miners. Again, it's the leaves of the trees that are affected. What happens is that insects settle on the leaves and eat their way round them, destroying them as they go, and at the same time they secrete a solution which has sugar in it. The Bellminer birds really like this solution, and in order to get as much as possible, they keep away other creatures that might try to get it. So these birds and insects flourish at the expense of other species, and eventually so much damage is done to the leaves that the tree dies. But experts say that trees can start looking sick before any sign of Bellminer associated dieback. So it looks as if the problem might have another explanation. One possibility is that it's to do with the huge bush fires that we have in Australia. A theory proposed over 40 years ago by ecologist William Jackson is that the frequency of bush fires in a particular region affects the type of vegetation that grows there. If there are very frequent bush fires in a region, this encourages grass to grow afterwards, while if the bush fires are rather less frequent, this results in the growth of eucalyptus forests. So why is this? Why do fairly frequent bush fires actually support the growth of eucalyptus? Well, one reason is that the fire stops the growth of other species which would consume water needed by eucalyptus trees. And there's another reason. If these other quick growing species of bushes and plants are allowed to proliferate, they harm the eucalyptus in another way by affecting the composition of the soil and removing nutrients from it. So some bush fires are actually essential for the eucalyptus to survive as long as they are not too frequent. In fact, there's evidence that Australia's indigenous people practiced regular burning of bush land for thousands of years before the arrival of the Europeans. But since Europeans arrived on the continent, the number of bush fires has been strictly controlled. Now scientists believe that this reduced frequency of bush fires to low levels has led to what's known as dry rainforest, which seems an odd name as usually we associate tropical rainforests with wet conditions. And what's special about this type of rainforest? Well, unlike tropical rainforest, which is a rich ecosystem, this type of ecosystem is usually a simple one. It has very thick dense vegetation, but not much variety of species. The vegetation provides lots of shade, so one species that does find it ideal is the bell-minor bird, which builds its nests in the undergrowth there. But again, that's not helpful for the eucalyptus tree.",369.844125,124.10633804173582,Ideal

short-stories-0263-266-ebenezer-scrooge.wav,"Ebenezer Scrooge. In the story of Christmas Carol, Scrooge is an English businessman who thinks about nothing but money. He has no friends, and spends no time with his family. He lives alone, eats alone, and works alone, except for his underpaid clerk-bob-cratchett. Scrooge never spends his money, but hordes it all and prides himself on his frugality. Scrooge hates Christmas. It's all nonsense to him. People spend money on food and gifts and parties. Often they can't afford what they spend. Worse than that, they take a whole day off work, and so lose a chance to make more money. Scrooge is angry that he has to give his clerk the day off with pay. He feels that he's being robbed. Christmas is also a time when people are asked to give money to help the poor. Scrooge is angry when two men come to his door asking for donations. Scrooge argues that he pays taxes, which support prisons and workhouses. It is not his business to worry about the problems of other people. Scrooge represents businessmen who see the bottom line as all that matters. Scrooge's partner Marley had died seven years earlier. He was like Scrooge in all respects. That evening, which is Christmas Eve, Scrooge is visited by Marley's Ghost. Marley drags steel chains round about him, which contain keys, cash boxes, ledgers, purses, and deeds. These are the things that Marley cared about when he was alive. Marley is condemned in death to wander the world and tell Scrooge that the same fate is likely to happen to him. However, three spirits will visit Scrooge, and if Scrooge listens to them, he may escape this fate. The first spirit comes and takes Scrooge back to the early scenes of his own life. He sees himself being left behind at school, while the other boys went home for the holidays. Then his little sister arrives to tell him he could go home, too. Another scene was of a cheerful Christmas party when Scrooge was a young man. A third scene showed him with the girl he was planning to marry. She left him because he no longer cared about anything but money. The second spirit shows Scrooge what people are doing that very Christmas. He shows Scrooge the preparations that people, even poor people, are making to celebrate Christmas. They visit Bob Cratchett's tiny home. There they see the family cooking their little Christmas dinner. Bob's son Tiny Tim has been weakened by disease and has to use a crutch to walk. The family is delighted with its meal small as it is. They see other scenes of poor people, minors and sailors, celebrating Christmas. Finally they visit Scrooge's nephew and view his Christmas party and its games. The third spirit was the spirit of Christmas yet to come. The future. This spirit does not talk, but points to scenes connected with Scrooge. They overhear some businessman joking about someone who has recently died. Scrooge sees that he no longer occupies his usual place of business. The spirit then shows him two women who have stolen the bedclothes, curtains and clothes off the dead man and taken them to a pawnbroker. The spirit takes Scrooge to the room where the dead man died. The only people who are happy about the death are a young couple who owed him money. The spirit then shows Scrooge the Cratchett's house where they're mourning the death of Tiny Tim. Finally the spirit takes him to a churchyard where they stand among the graves. Then the spirit points to the name of the dead man on the tombstone, Ebenezer Scrooge. Scrooge is going to die and no one will care. Scrooge finds himself in his own bed on Christmas morning. He is resolved now to avoid the fate that the spirits had shown him. He is delighted that he is getting a second chance. Scrooge decides to surprise all his acquaintances and he begins by buying a huge goose and sending it to the Cratchett's. On his walk he meets the two men collecting for the poor and offers him a large sum of money. He goes on to join his nephew at a Christmas party. The next day when Bob Cratchett comes into work, Scrooge gives him a raise in his salary. He also takes care of Tiny Tim so that Tim recovers his health. Charles Dickens' story was written at a time when governments did very little to help the poor. Wages were very low and many businessmen were unwilling to look after their workers properly. Dickens points out that people like Scrooge not only make other people unhappy, but also are usually unhappy themselves. It is possible to be a very rich businessman and a poor human being at the same time.",270.9681875,178.24970689594326,Fast
short-stories-0234-236-telephone-systems.wav,"Telephone Systems. When Alexander Graham Bell developed the telephone in the 1870s, it was fairly simple to use. You talked into the mouthpiece and then held it to your ear to listen. For a century or so, using the telephone meant either contacting the operator to dial a number or dialing yourself. After that, all you had to do was talk or listen. Nowadays, the telephone has become a very complex instrument. It rivals the computer as to the number of possible uses. Answering machines have been around for several decades, but they are now being replaced by voicemail. Voicemail does away with the need for an answering machine. Messages are stored on the system. That means it's possible to forward the message to someone else's phone or transfer the call to a more convenient phone of your own. You can also use call pickup so that anyone on your group can answer another's phone. Conference calls have become very common. This is when one person phones first one person, then another, and keeps adding people to the telephone conversation. This can regularly be done with up to six people. It is very useful for business discussions where different people need to talk about the same thing. It also speeds up the process of consensus and allows everybody to be in on the decision or discussion. The modern phone has many more features. If you don't want the color to know what is being said in your office, you can push the mute button. If you want to hang up without putting the receiver down, press goodbye. If you don't want to receive calls, just forward them all into your voicemail. Newer phones will indicate when you have voicemail messages. If you have trouble with these features, an automatic voice will tell you your options. This help system is built into the telephone. For example, the help voice will tell you how to set up a distribution list so that you can send the same voice message to a number of people. It will also tell you how to send a message directly into someone's voicemail. You can designate your message to go to the top of the recipient's voicemail list. You can also program it so that the recipient cannot forward it. Some systems have limits on how much space can be used for individual voicemail. There are a number of courtesy that voicemail users should follow. Your greeting on your voicemail should be simple. If you are unable to take calls for any reason, you might want to explain that in your recorded greeting. If you are on vacation, you might want to include that information in your greeting. Don't use voicemail as a way to avoid answering the telephone. Some people use voicemail to screen calls. This can be annoying to someone who can never contact you directly. Check your messages regularly and reply to them promptly. Enjoy the telecommunications revolution.",164.715375,179.94677181774927,Fast

short-stories-0222-224-george-w-bush-jr.wav,"George W. Bush Jr. George W. Bush Jr. was inaugurated as the 43rd President of the United States on January 20, 2001. Of course, people knew that he was the son of the 41st President, George H. W. Bush. He had also been governor of Texas since 1994. However, aside from this, he was not very well known outside of Texas. Why then did so many people want him to run for President in 2000? Many Republicans thought that the Democrats could be defeated in 2000, but they themselves lacked a candidate with strong appeal. As the election approached, leading Republicans worried about whom to support. Some of the most powerful Republicans were state governors. They began to look around at each other for a possible candidate. Most eyes turned to George W. Bush, the governor of Texas. In November 1998, Bush was reelected as governor by an impressive margin. By now, Bush was the leading Republican candidate in the polls. Of course, one advantage that governor Bush had was a familiar name. In fact, when he did well in some early polls, it is likely that some people really voted for his father. They thought that George H. W. Bush was running again. The Bush family was able to swing a lot of support to George W. It also helped that his brother, Jeb, was now governor of Florida. Parents George and Barbara were both born in Eastern United States, but in 1948 George moved to Texas where he made a fortune in the oil business. He went into politics in the 1960s and 70s and served in a number of important positions. He was Ronald Reagan's vice president from 1981 to 1989 and president from 1989 to 1993. George W. was born in 1946 the oldest of the Bush children. Three more brothers and two sisters were also born. The youngest sister died of leukemia as a child. George W. attended the same prestigious Eastern colleges as his father. Then he came back to Texas and was a fighter pilot with the Texas Air National Guard. During the early 70s, he wandered from place to place trying different jobs. After attending Harvard Business School from 1972 to 1975, he came back to Texas and started his own oil exploration company. Although it wasn't as profitable as his father's company, he eventually sold his stock shares for a considerable amount of money. In 1978, he ran for the Senate of the United States, but was defeated. He became closely involved in his father's campaign for president in 1988. Here he developed a lot of the political skills he was later able to use to run for office himself. In 1989 back in Texas, George W. organized a group that bought the Texas Rangers baseball team. He later sold the team in 1998 and made a $14 million profit. In 1994, he surprised the political world by defeating the incumbent governor of Texas. As governor, he pushed ahead with an energetic program which reflected neo-conservative values. However, George W. did not appear as an ideologist to people. Even his opponents were willing to work with him. When he ran for president in 2000, Bush described himself as a compassionate conservative. Only time will tell how successful Bush will be as U.S. president.",223.5298125,148.1681554222214,Ideal
ielts-listening-0126-cam12-test-4-part-2.wav,"Welcome to this podcast about the sheep market, which is one of the oldest parts of the city. As its name suggests, there was originally a market here where farmers brought their sheep, but now it's been redeveloped into a buzzing, vibrant area of the city, which is also home to one of the city's fastest growing communities. The nearby university has always meant the areas popular with students who come in to enjoy the lively nightlife, but now graduates embarking on careers in the worlds of fashion and design are buying up the new apartments recently built here to replace the small houses where the market workers used to live. The narrow old side streets are great places for finding original pictures, jewelry and ceramics which won't break the bank, as well as local produce like fruit and vegetables. There's also lots of pavement cafes where you can have a coffee and watch tourists from all over the world go by. The oldest buildings in the area are on the main streets, including the city's first department store built in the 1880s which is still open today. The sheep market is a centre for fashion and there's a policy of encouraging new young designers. The young fashion competition is open to local young people who are passionate about fashion. This year they've been asked to design an outfit based on ideas from the music and technology that's part of their everyday life, using both natural and man-made fibers. The garments will be judged by a panel of experts and fashion designers and the winning entries will be modeled at a special gala evening. Parking at the sheep market is easy. There are plenty of pay and display car parking spaces on the road sides which are fine if you just want to stay for an hour or two, but if you want to spend the day there it's better to park in one of the four underground car parks. It's not expensive and if you can present a receipt from one of the local stores you'll not be charged at all. After 6pm many of the car parks have a flat rate which varies but it is usually very reasonable. The sheep market is one of the main centres for art and history in the whole of the country. If you look at our map you'll see some of the main attractions there. Most visitors start from Crawley Road at the bottom of the map. The Reynolds House is one of the oldest houses in the city and is open to the public. It's on the north side of Crawley Road next to the footpath that leads to the public gardens. The area is particularly interesting for its unusual sculptures. The thumb is just what its name suggests but it's about 10 metres high. You'll see it on Hill Road across the road from the bank. The museum's got a particularly fine collection of New Zealand landscapes. It's on the east side of the sheep market on City Road. It's on the other side of the road from the public gardens immediately facing the junction with Hill Road. The contemporary art gallery is on a little road that leads up station square not far from the public gardens. The road ends at the gallery, it doesn't go anywhere else. That's open every day except Mondays. The Warner Gallery specialises in 19th century art. It's on City Road near the junction with Crawley Road on the same side of the road as the public gardens. It's open on weekdays from 9 to 5 and entry is free. Finally, if you're interested in purchasing high quality artwork, the place to go is nucleus. You need to go from Crawley Road up through station square and east along Hill Road until you get to a small winding road turning off. Go up there and it's on your right. If you get to City Road, you've gone too far.",221.8058125,180.1575871687312,Fast

A man told me that he would teach me how to dance. It looked very easy. I held one of his hands and put my other hand on his shoulder. He told me exactly how to move my feet. I was very clumsy and I stepped on his toes. He was patient with me and he counted 1, 2, 3. I tried to waltz with him. I would start out pretty well but then I would get mixed up and stand on his toes again. The man laughed about it.

short-stories-0175-176-benjamin-franklin.wav,"Benjamin Franklin. Benjamin Franklin was one of the most famous people in American history. He was never president of the United States, but he made great achievements in many areas of life, including business, literature, science, and politics. Benjamin Franklin was born in the city of Boston during the year 1706. In his early years, Franklin was very poor. As a young man, he worked for his older brother, who was a printer. However, the two brothers soon argued with each other. Benjamin decided to leave, and he moved to the city of Philadelphia. He worked very hard, and soon became a successful printer. He published his own newspapers, and he also published books called Almanacs, which contained many wise sayings. Many of the wise sayings in Franklin's Almanacs are still repeated today. Franklin's printing business was very successful, but he was also very interested in science. He performed experiments on the topic of electricity. Some of these experiments were very dangerous. In one experiment, Franklin was almost killed when he went outside during a lightning storm and flew a kite that had a metal key attached. However, Franklin was lucky enough to avoid injury, and he learned new facts about electricity. In addition to scientific research, Franklin was also an inventor. He invented a new kind of eyeglasses, called Bifocals. Bifocals are eyeglasses that allow people to see things that are far away, but also allow them to read things that are very close. Another invention was a new kind of stove for burning wood. This new stove was much more efficient than the older stoves had been. He also invented a lightning rod, which keeps houses safe from lightning. Franklin was also interested in making his city a better place to live. He started a public library, and he helped to organize a hospital and a fire department. In addition, he supervised the Postal Service, which operated profitably under his command. In his later years, Franklin became heavily involved in politics. For most of Franklin's life, the United States was not yet a country. Instead, the United States were still colonies of England, but Franklin encouraged other Americans to become an independent country. When the United States became a country, Franklin became the American ambassador to France. The French people liked Franklin very much. Franklin later returned to the United States, and he died in 1790. Today, many Americans still admire the brilliant achievements of Benjamin Franklin, who did so much to improve people's lives.

short-stories-0284-288-garage-sales-and-yard-sales.wav,"Garage sales and yard sales. Every Saturday morning in our part of the world, except in winter, many people drive around the city looking for yard sales. Yard sales or garage sales often take place in the driveway of someone's home or perhaps the front lawn. The homeowners take out all the stuff they don't want and arrange it in front of their house. Usually they put a price tag on items, people driving by will stop to see if there's anything they want. Many people spend every Saturday morning shopping at yard sales. If they find that they have bought too many things, then they have a yard sale of their own. Some of the shoppers are dealers who buy things for resale. Sometimes they resell them at their own yard sales, but some dealers are professionals who run antique stores, used book shops, flea markets, or used furniture and appliance stores. Usually the dealers will try to get to the yard sale before anyone else. That way they have the best selection. Often they'll try to buy items for less than what the price tag says. The cheaper they can buy the item, the more profit they can make when they resell it. Their motto is, buy low, sell high. Sometimes a merchant will boast that he paid one dollar for a glass or a china cup at a yard sale and sold it for a hundred dollars at his store or on the internet. By having catalogs that show the value of collectibles, dealers can sometimes make large profits. Now, however, many of the people having yard sales will try to check the value of the things they are selling first. So it is getting harder to get a real bargain. One reason for yard sales is that North Americans often live in big houses, which fill up with things. People may use the basement, the attic, the spare room, and the garage to store things that they aren't using. If they store things in their garage, all they have to do is open the garage door and have a garage sale. When children grow up and move away, the parents will often sell the children's old clothes, toys, and furniture. Another reason for yard sales is that there are a lot of things that people might like, but don't want to pay full price for. For example, if someone likes to read novels, they may be happy to pay one dollar for a book at a yard sale rather than twenty or thirty dollars at a retail store. What sorts of things are sold at yard sales? Just about anything you might find in a house or yard. There are ornaments, China, home decorations, sports equipment, bicycles, games, dolls, toys, tables, and chairs, lamps, appliances, books, records, paintings, clothes, record players, and much, much more. Some items are things that were popular a few years ago, but now have gone out of fashion. This might include many toys, books, and games that relate to an old television show that is no longer being shown. While a lot of older people go to yard sales, so do a lot of students. Students and young people may need cheap furniture for their apartment or a bicycle to get to school or work. They may not be able to pay full price. If you are lucky, you can find almost anything at a yard sale. The trick is to get there early. Most yard sales are advertised to start at 9 a.m., but dealers may arrive as early as 7.30 a.m. By 10 a.m., the busiest part is already over. Although most yard sales go on into the afternoon, yard sales tend to prove the comments saying that one person's trash is another person's treasure.",204.878375,186.256846287462,Fast

ielts-listening-0318-ielts-recent-actual-test-32-part-2.wav,"Welcome everyone to today's seminar on CV and interview skills. Remember your CV is probably the most important document you will ever write. It opens the door to your career and that job interview is probably the most important meeting you will ever attend. It's like stepping through that open door. So let's roll up our sleeves and get down to work shall we? First of all, I cannot possibly tell you everything you need to know about writing a resume in the time we have. But let me tell you that there are dozens of great websites on the internet. These will give you all the suggestions you need. If you look at the paper I gave you, you will see a list of the dozen most popular sites. I can mention a couple of important points however. One is that your CV or resume should not be too long. A page is about right. Why? HR departments do not have the time to read long documents. Too many people are sending too many CVs. After all, the economic crisis of 2008 is still very much alive. Everyone needs a job now. No matter how short you make that resume though, you do not want to forget to tell HR how to contact your references. References are people who will give you a recommendation for a job. That's usually an ex-boss or a professor who knows you well. Do not use relatives. I don't care how much your mum loves you. Also, when you send that CV, be sure to include a typed cover letter. A cover letter is a letter where you basically are asking for a job. Just like introducing yourself, make it brief. The real information about you is on that CV of yours and please make sure the letter is typed. It doesn't matter if your handwriting is beautiful or not. Companies only read typed letters. Another point about CVs is you should try to have an attractive layout. Maybe use different type fonts or colours to highlight information. Some people include a photo. You can find dozens of examples on the internet. Whatever layout you decide to use, however, avoid all spelling and grammar errors. I used to be an HR manager. If I saw a mistake, that CV went into the garbage. Something you write in a CV is a description of your skills and experiences in an interesting way. Mention training too. I mean, these are what get you hired. Do not just say I have lots of experience or I have many skills. Tell that boss what you did for what company and when. Better tell him how well you did it. Don't just say I sold houses. Say I sold two million pounds worth of houses in my first year. That is say something to make the person reading excited and curious. Finally, speaking of CVs, it's sad, but some people actually forget to provide a contact number. That's pretty silly. You wrote a great CV. You have HR dying to meet you and they don't know how. You forgot your phone number. Oh sure, if you apply online, they have your email address, but you just showed them you're forgetful. Why are they going to want to talk to you after that? Alright, moving on to the actual interview. I'll go over what you need to know by the end of it and what you can discuss and negotiate on later once it looks like you'll be offered the job. First, there's working hours. It's not that necessary to hammer out the hours off the bat, especially since it's easy to come off as lazy when the first thing you bring up is how much you're going to have to work. You can also find out more about possible promotions later on. It is important, however, to get a feel for how much you'll be paid. You should make sure the salary range is commensurate with what you're worth and if you're not, you can move on to better opportunities. Being sure you're going to make what you want to live on is much more important than issues like your pension. You're also young. That your pension is not going to matter for quite a long time. You should find out about what skills you must know for the job and what they'll teach you. In addition, if the company will provide training, you should find out how long the training period is and whether it is paid. Beware of any jobs that want you to train for a long time without appropriate compensation. Speaking of compensation, find out about holidays as well. Do you get paid vacation time? Are you allowed to take personal days? Do you have to work on national holidays? Once you work out these main issues, you can move on later to details like the location and expected attire and what not. Wow, that's a lot of information. Let's take a break so you can think everything over and ask any questions you may have. Don't hesitate to come and see me if you need any clarification on all this stuff.",312.886875,166.25817238259037,Fast

short-stories-0245-248-medical-missionary.wav,"Medical Missionary During the reign of Queen Victoria, 1837-1901, British people traveled around the whole world. They charted the seas, mapped out distant countries, and studied plants, animals, and people. They also claimed many lands for England. This kind of international travel was made easier by improved transportation and communication. New inventions such as steamships, trains, telegraphs, and telephones made long distances seem smaller. Of course, people had different reasons for going to distant lands. Some were businessmen who saw economic opportunities overseas. Soldiers wanted fame and a chance to enlarge the British Empire. Big Game Hunters wanted to be the first to shoot strange animals and bring back trophies to England. Scientists intended to study unknown animals and plants. Missionaries planned to be the first to introduce Christianity to far away people. In 1836, a young Scotsman called David Livingston began to study medicine in Glasgow. Livingston intended to become a medical missionary. This means that he would be a doctor, as well as a preacher and teacher. Livingston, 1813-1873, came from a poor family. From an early age, he had worked 14 hours a day in a clothing factory for very little pay, but he was determined to learn. He took his books with him to the factory and read as he worked. Then, after work, he would go to his teacher to learn more. Livingston's goal was to teach far away people about Jesus. However, unlike some missionaries, he was also interested in science, geography, and exploring. He had planned to go to China in 1839, but because of the opium wars, no missionaries were being sent there. Instead, he asked to go to South Africa. Europeans had traveled around the coasts of Africa for hundreds of years, but very few white people had traveled inland. A missionary named Robert Moffitt, who had begun a mission at Kuremen in the interior, inspired Livingston. Livingston arrived in Kuremen in 1841. This was the farthest outpost of white settlement, and no one seemed to want to go further inland. Livingston felt that the missionaries should go to the Africans, rather than waiting for the Africans to come to them. With a fellow missionary, he set out. When they came to an African tribe, they would talk to the chief and ask permission to preach to his people. Livingston would also set up a tent and treat the people who had diseases. After a while, he would move on to the next tribe. Once Livingston learned the Bantu language, he would talk to many Africans, but sometimes he needed interpreters. There were many diseases, including malaria and sleeping sickness. Livingston suffered much of his life from river fever. He was also so weak that he rode on the back of an ox. Livingston wanted to stop the slave trade. At this time, the slave trade was the most profitable business in Africa. Livingston hoped that if other kinds of trade were developed, then slavery could be abolished. In order to open up trade, he wanted to find an easy route into the center of Africa. Livingston kept going further into the interior. He was probably the first European to cross the Kalahari Desert before reaching Lake Nagami in present-day Botswana. Not long after, he traveled further inland. He explored the sources of the Zambezi and Kansai rivers and eventually reached the west coast of Africa and Luwanda and Gola. Livingston was being criticized for neglecting missionary work in order to explore. Livingston replied that he was opening up the continent for missionaries. Meanwhile, he was becoming famous as a great explorer. The British government commissioned him to explore the Zambezi river. They hoped that ships could sail up the river into the interior. Unfortunately, the Zambezi had too many rapids. However, Livingston did find a route up the Shire River to Lake Nagasa. He continued to struggle against the slave trade, which is now being taken over by Arabs. Livingston died in Africa in 1873. He was the first white man to explore Botswana, Zimbawi, Zambia, Malawi, and surrounding areas. He was not only a great explorer, but also a fine doctor and a good missionary. Nowadays, the countries that Livingston visited are nearly all Christian, just as he had hoped they would be.",295.5494375,144.9503689209356,Ideal

short-stories-0220-222-niagara-falls.wav,"Niagara Falls Niagara Falls is one of the world's leading tourist attractions. Millions of people around the world visit here each year. Summers at the falls are especially busy, with traffic jams and parking problems, however, the falls are beautiful in winter too. Many have asked why people travel so far to see water falling over a cliff. The size and beauty of Niagara Falls help to make it special. While many falls are higher than Niagara, very few are as wide or have such a volume of water. It also helps that Niagara is relatively easy to travel to. When the first Europeans came to Niagara, the falls were surrounded by forest. The noise of the falls could be heard miles away before they were actually seen. The first visitors were filled with horror at the site. Later, fear ceased to be the main emotion inspired by the falls. Later, visitors were impressed by the beauty and grandeur of the falls, which overwhelmed them with wonder. By the 1830s, people were able to come to the falls by railway, as more and more people came, the tourist industry developed. Early tourism was not well regulated, and there were many complaints about cheats and swindles. Today, there are similar complaints about tourist junk and high prices. The majority of tourists stay on the Canadian side. There are two falls separated by an island. Since the Niagara River forms the boundary here between Canada and the United States, each country has one of the falls. The Canadian Horseshoe Falls is wider and more impressive than the American Rainbow Falls. About nine times more water goes over the Canadian Falls. Nonetheless, there is much to be seen on the American side. The island in the middle, goat island, is one of the best places to view the falls and rapids. It is on the American side. Newly married couples began coming to Niagara Falls when it was still a secluded, peaceful and romantic spot. It is still popular with newlyweds as a relatively inexpensive and convenient place to spend their honeymoon. Besides being beautiful, Niagara Falls is also very useful. Their falling water is the power behind several of the largest hydroelectric stations in the world. Much of the electric power used in this part of North America comes from Niagara Falls. In order to harness this power, half of the flow of water is channeled away from the falls during the night and during the non-tourist season. Probably most visitors don't notice the difference. Niagara has attracted many kinds of people over the years. Businessmen have come to profit from the tourists. Daredevils have come to make a name for themselves. Some have gone over the falls in a barrel, while others have walked above the falls on a tightrope. Poets and artists have visited here to capture its beauty. Lovers have come to gaze on its romantic scenery. All of these and many others have helped to make Niagara Falls world famous.",196.8588125,153.00305644178363,Fast

ielts-listening-0046-cam17-test-4-part-2.wav,"As many of you here today have worked in the hotel industry for some time, I'm sure you have experienced the problem of high staff turnover in your hotels. Every hotel relies on having loyal and experienced members of staff who make sure that everything runs smoothly. If staff are constantly changing, it can make life difficult for everyone. But why do staff leave frequently in many hotels? Of course, many hotel jobs, such as cleaning, are low skilled and are not well paid. A lot of managers think it's this and the long hours that are the main causes of high staff turnover. But what they don't realize is that it's the lack of training in many hotel jobs, which is a huge factor. So what kind of problems does a high turnover of staff cause? Well, having to recruit new staff all the time can be very time consuming, and managers may have to cover some duties while waiting for new staff to arrive. This means they don't have time to think about less immediate problems, such as how to improve their service. Even staff leave, it can also severely affect the colleagues they leave behind. It has a negative effect on remaining staff, who may start to feel that they too should be thinking about leaving. So what can be done to change this situation? Firstly, managers should stop making basic errors, which leave their staff feeling upset and resentful. Inorganizing shifts, for example, make sure you never give certain staff preferential treatment. All staff should be given some choice about when they work, and everyone should have to work some evening and weekend shifts. If you treat staff fairly, they'll be more likely to step in and help when extra staff are needed. Having staff happy has other tangible benefits for the business. Take the Donnich Hotel as an example. It had been experiencing a problem with staff complaints, and in order to deal with this, invested in staff training, and improved staff conditions. Not only did the level of complaints fall, but they also noticed a significant increase in the amount each customer spent during their stay. They have now introduced a customer loyalty scheme, which is going really well. Now, I'd like to look at some ways you can reduce staff turnover in your hotels, and I'll do this by giving some examples of hotels where I've done some training recently. The Sun Club received feedback, which showed that staff thought managers didn't value their opinions. They weren't made to feel they were partners who are contributing to the success of the business as a whole. This situation has changed. Junior staff at all levels are regularly invited to meetings where their ideas are welcomed. A year ago, the Portland recognized the need to invest in staff retention. Their first step was to introduce a scheme for recognizing talent amongst their employees. The hope is that organizing training for individuals with management potential will encourage them to stay with the business. At Bluewater, managers decided to recognize 50 high achievers from across the company's huge hotel chain. As a reward, they sent on on all expenses paid trip abroad every year. Fun is an important element in the trips, but there's also the opportunity to learn something useful. This year's trip included a visit to a brewery where staff learned about the new beer that would be served in the hotel. Good low hotels identified that retention of junior reception staff was an issue. In order to encourage them to see that working in a hotel could be worthwhile and rewarding with good prospects, they introduced a management program. These staff were given additional responsibilities and the chance to work in various roles in the hotel. One planet wanted to be seen as a caring employer. To make life easier for staff, many of whom had childcare responsibilities, the hotel began issuing vouchers to help cover the cost of childcare. Louise Marsh, at the Amesbury, has one of the best staff retention rates in the business. Since she joined the company, she's made a huge effort to achieve this by creating a co-operative and supportive environment. For her, the staff are part of a large family where everyone is valued.

short-stories-0261-264-death-valley-california.wav,"Death Valley, California. The steep mountains of southeastern California dip suddenly into a deep valley. Rain is kept out of the valley by the high mountains, which form its western slopes. Although mountains surround the valley, death valley itself is very low. In fact, its lowest point is 282 feet below sea level, the lowest point of land in North or South America. Death Valley is about 140 miles long, but only a few miles wide. It got its name in 1849 during the California Gold Rush. Gold seagrers attempted to cross death valley on the way to California's Goldfields, and some died of thirst there. There's hardly any water in the valley. The average rainfall is only a couple of inches a year. It is also one of the hottest places in North America in the summer. Temperatures of 134 Fahrenheit have been recorded. As a result of this heat and dryness, death valley is a desert. These conditions give rise to the valley's most important products, mineral salt and salt deposits. One of these products is borax, which has many industrial uses. Borax was removed from the desert using 20 mule teams, hitched in a long string. Later, a railway was built to help carry out these minerals. In spite of its desert conditions, death valley has considerable animal and plant life. Of course, its animals and plants are those typical in desert conditions, only on the salt flats do plants refuse to grow. With even a small rainfall in the spring, the desert will come alive with wild flowers. Very few places in the world have such a contrast in heights and depths. The mountains near the valley are among the highest and continental USA, while the valley itself is the lowest elevation. Mount Whitney, at 14,495 feet, is less than 100 miles from death valley. The climate in the valley from October to May is generally pleasant. Since death valley is now a national park, many tourists visit during this season. Now roads and hotels provide comfortable access. Death valley is located close to the Nevada border. Its desert conditions are common throughout the area of the American West, just east of the coastal mountains. In most cases, heavy rain falls along the coast, but very little in the interior. Because there is no farming and water is hard to obtain, death valley and similar desert areas have very few permanent residents.",147.591875,165.0497359695444,Fast

short-stories-0203-204-how-the-first-world-war-started.wav,"How the First World War started. During the summer of 1914, many people in Europe felt very optimistic about the future. Modern technology was improving people's lives. Political freedom was gradually increasing in many countries. New artistic styles and scientific discoveries were being made. But later that summer, a terrible war began. In the early 20th century, the various countries of Europe competed with each other in an attempt to be the most powerful country on the continent. In each country, many of the political leaders wanted to control more land, more people, and more resources. The First World War began when the Archduke of Austria-Hungary was assassinated. Austria-Hungary wanted to punish the assassin, who was from the small country of Serbia. This led to a serious dispute, and soon other countries were involved. Within a few weeks, a war had begun. On one side were Germany and Austria-Hungary, and on the other side were Russia, France, and Britain. The people in these countries at first welcomed the news of a war. Many people were intensely patriotic, and supported the war effort, without thinking carefully about the reasons for the war. Some people thought that war would bring adventure and glory to their lives, and they cheered enthusiastically in the streets. After the war started, it soon became clear that it was a terrible disaster. In the western part of Europe, the opposing sides fought many bloody battles. Soldiers on both sides lived in filthy trenches that had been dug out of the ground. Sometimes hundreds of thousands of men were killed in battles that lasted only a few days. In most cases, these battles did not result in large gains or losses of territory. The war continued for more than four years. When the war was finally over, millions of people had been killed. Many people realized that their eagerness to fight against other countries had led them into a great disaster. This disaster did not end when the war ended in 1918. During the next 30 years, there would be many violent revolutions in Europe, and a second major war that would be even worse than the first. Today, people in most European countries no longer view other nations as enemies. They have no interest in fighting wars with their neighbors. Instead, they're interested in trading with the other countries, and in visiting those countries as tourists. The lessons of the 20th century have reminded people that wars can have terrible consequences.",157.1788125,158.03656742857757,Fast

ielts-listening-0302-ielts-recent-actual-test-8-part-2.wav,"Good evening. I'm Jeffrey Miller from the University of Nottingham Student Union. And in this week's three-class, Carlos Garcia is going to tell us about safety around campus. Over to you, Carlos. Thank you, Jeffrey. And thank you all for your attendance today. Also, I'd like to thank the student union here at the University for organizing this lecture. Well, I've been serving and protecting the City of Nottingham for over 20 years now as a member of the police department. There's anyone know what type of crime is the most prevalent on campus? I heard someone say, drugs and alcohol. That actually isn't too much of an issue. Violence? Nope. Actually, the biggest thing we worry about here is theft. The nature of crime on Nottingham's campus is quite different from that of the surrounding areas. Crime rates across the East Midlands are very difficult to control. We'd like to see the rates stay the same for this calendar year, but it has been increasing steadily over the past three years. On campus, however, I'm happy to say that the overall crime rate has fallen this year. You wouldn't think so if you've seen the extremely exaggerated stories in the media. The media has done nothing but cause more concern about crime in our area. Even the crime shows you see today are a little bit far-fetched, but at least viewers know they're not real events. We'd really like to see more factual news articles out there, so the public can have a rational sense of the safety level of our society. Okay, let's move on to what to do when you see a crime. Do not get involved if at all possible, and do not draw too much attention to yourself by running away in a conspicuous manner. Though most likely, and hopefully, you will not have to experience this situation, if you are being mugged, please do not try to resist. Instead, be compliant and seek help after the incident. Like I said, though, it is highly unlikely that you will find yourself amidst a crime, but it is important to be prepared should it ever happen. We find that educating students and staff on the correct precautions to take is the best way to increase your safety. Just remember to be smart when you're out late at night and avoid any area or person that looks suspicious. I know it sounds obvious, but I cannot stress this enough. It's also not a bad idea to have your mobile phone with you at all times, but be careful. If you're chatting on your smartphone, on your way home, you're a prime target for thieves. I'd like to see a show of hands. How many people have left work or the library after 10pm to go home before? A lot of you. Right? If you do have to go home late at night, please don't walk home alone. More often than not, there's someone there that will be walking the same direction as you at the some point. Walk home with a friend or coworker. Even if you must use your phone to call someone that's nearby to walk with you, it's always safer to walk home with someone. So when you're walking home, you may feel more comfortable with some sort of self-defense, such as pepper spray. Now, is your call whether you want to carry something like this or not? However, I absolutely advise against carrying a knife or any other offensive weapon. Also often, they can be used against you if you're disarmed, putting yourself in more danger. For all those interested, the Recreation Center offers a free self-defense class to all students every Thursday evening. While obviously an introductory self-defense class may not equip you to fight off villains like a regular superhero, it does come in handy sometimes. After taking a self-defense class, you'll surely be more aware of possible dangers and how to deal with them. So hopefully now, you have a more complete understanding of the nature of crimes committed on your campus and how to avoid being a victim. I know most students at the University of Nottingham are not the criminal types, but remember that there is no barrier like a wall or something keeping non-students out. There's no army force securing the borders and I doubt anyone wants it that way. The campus is generally a safe place, but it's not immune to small crimes once in a while. Alright, that's all I have to say for today. Stay safe.",286.9575,159.3267295679674,Fast

ielts-listening-0228-cam5-test-1-part-4.wav,"Okay, so we've been looking at the attitudes of various social and cultural groups towards the management of their personal finances. How important they feel it is to save money, and what they save their money for. One aspect that we haven't yet considered is gender. So if we consider gender issues, we're basically asking whether men and women have different attitudes towards saving money, and whether they save money for different things. Back in 1928, the British writer George Bernard Shaw wrote in his Intelligent Women's Guide to Socialism and Capitalism that a man is supposed to understand politics, economics, and finance, and is therefore unwilling to accept essential instruction. He also said, a woman, having fewer pretensions, is far more willing to learn. Now though these days people might question a lot of the assumptions contained in those statements, recent research does suggest that there are some quite fundamental differences between men and women in their attitudes to economic matters. Let's look at what men and women actually save for. Research studies of women in North America have found that women are far more likely to save for their children's education, and they are also more likely to save up in order to buy a house one day. The same studies have found that men, on the other hand, tend to save for a car, which, by the way, takes a surprisingly large amount of the household budget in North America. But the other main priority for men when saving money is their retirement. When they're earning, they're far more likely to put money aside for their old age than women are. Now this is rather disturbing, because in fact the need for women to save for their old age is far greater than for men. Let's consider this for a moment. To start with, it is a fact that throughout the world women are likely to live many years longer than men, so they need money to support them during this time. Since women are likely to be the ones left without a partner in old age, they may therefore have to pay for nursing care, because they don't have a spouse to look after them. Furthermore, the high divorce rates in North America are creating a poverty cycle for women. It is the divorced women who will most often have to look after the children, and thus, they need more money to look after, not just themselves, but others. So what can be done about this situation? The population in North America is likely to contain an increasing number of elderly women. The research indicates that at present for women it takes a crisis to make them think about their future financial situation. But of course, this is the very worst time for anyone to make important decisions. Women today need to look ahead, think ahead, not wait until they're under pressure. Even women in their early 20s need to think about pensions, for example, and with increasing numbers of women in professional positions, there are signs that this is beginning to happen. Then research also suggests that women avoid dealing effectively with their economic situation because of a lack of confidence. The best way for them to overcome this is by getting themselves properly informed, so they are less dependent on other people's advice. A number of initiatives have been set up to help them do this. This college, for example, is one of the educational institutions which offers night classes in money management, and increasing numbers of women are enrolling on such courses. Here they can be given advice on different ways of saving. Many women are unwilling to invest in stocks and shares, for instance. But these can be extremely profitable. It is usually advised that at least 70% of a person's savings should be in low risk investments. But for the rest, financial advisors often advise taking some well-informed risks. Initiatives such as this can give women the economic skills and knowledge they need for a comfortable, independent retirement. The increasing proportion of elderly women in the population is likely to have other",271.79675,152.54045532185359,Fast

Now in today's show we're looking at beds for children and babies. Let's start by looking at baby cuts. That's for children of up to three years old. We tested three different cuts all in the budget price range and as usual we will feature the good points, the problems and our verdict. The first cut we looked at was by baby safe and it had several good points to recommend it. Our testers liked the fact that it had four wheels so it was easy to move around. The only slide problems with this cut were that it had no brakes but they didn't think that mattered too much. At first they were a bit concerned about the sidebar because they felt babies could trap their fingers in it. But our testers felt that this was unlikely to happen so they've given this one a verdict of satisfactory. The next cut was by choice cuts and this time our testers were pleased to find a cut which is simple to put together unlike others we looked at. On the minus side our testers did not like the fact that the side of the cut did not drop down, making it difficult to pick up newborn babies. However, the real problem with this cut was the space between the bars. Our testers found they were too wide and a baby could easily trap his head. We felt this was a real safety hazard and so we've labeled this one dangerous. I'm afraid. And finally better news for the mother's choice cut. This cut was slightly different in that although the sidebar did not drop down the base could be raised or lowered into two different positions, making it safe as well as convenient. The negatives for this one were quite minor. The only niggle everyone had was the fact that it has no wheels and the only other problem anyone could find was that there were pictures which were simply stuck on and so could easily become detached. The makers have now promised to discontinue this practice as this cut will then be safe in every way. We have made the mother's choice cut our best buy. Congratulations mother's choice. So what features should you look for in a baby's cut? Well obviously safety is a very important factor as well as comfort and convenience. We recommend that if you are buying a cut do make sure that any metal present is not rusted or bent in any way. You should ensure your cut has only rounded or smooth edging without any sharp edges. This is especially important for wooden cuts. And now onto beds for toddlers.",165.2245,170.31372465947845,Fast

My dad explained to my brother that superheroes are not real. Real people cannot fly from rooftops. My brother was disappointed. He thought that the superheroes really existed.

short-stories-0173-174-african-slavery-in-the-america.wav,"African slavery in the Americas. One of the most tragic parts of the history of North and South America is the period of African slavery. For hundreds of years, many people were taken from Africa by force to work in the fields of many different countries in North and South America. When Europeans first came to the Americas, some of them realized that they might make money by growing crops and selling them in Europe. However, in order to make money, they would need a cheap source of labor. Few Europeans would come to the Americas to work for low wages, so instead, the landowners looked for slaves. In the areas of great farms or plantations, there were few Indians, so they used another source of slaves. Africa. The plantation owners usually obtained slaves by buying them from local kings in western Africa. These led to many wars between rival kings within Africa who tried to capture each other's people in order to sell them as slaves. A few kings tried to avoid the slave trade, but this was very difficult. During a period of several hundred years, from the 1500s to the 1800s, about 12 million people were taken from western Africa to the Americas. Many more people died as slaves before leaving Africa, and many more died on the ships that took them to the Americas. This was because the conditions on the ships were extremely unhealthy. The ships were far too crowded, and there was little food and water. When the African slaves arrived in the Americas, the plantation owners made them work on farms that produced goods such as cotton and sugar. In many places, they worked very hard, and many of the slaves died from overwork. They were then replaced by other slaves who arrived from Africa. However, many slaves survived despite the brutal conditions. In some places, the African slaves were able to revolt against the plantation owners. However, this was difficult because the slaves who had recently arrived spoke many different languages. Some slaves escaped into wilderness areas, and were able to remain free from the plantation owners. As time went by, many people in Europe and in the Americas realized that slavery was wrong. By the 1830s, slavery had been ended or abolished in islands owned by the British, and in parts of the United States. In the southern United States, slavery was ended in the 1860s during the Civil War. In some countries such as Brazil and Cuba, slavery only ended in the 1880s. Today many millions of people in North and South America are descendants of slaves who were brought from Africa. The effects of slavery have lasted for many generations, and there was much racial prejudice against African people when slavery ended. However, some have achieved success despite these disadvantages. Today, the people of African background in North and South America are a very important part of the population in many countries.",184.37225,160.43629125315766,Fast

ielts-listening-0132-cam11-test-1-part-4.wav,"I've been looking at ocean biodiversity, that's the diversity of species that live in the world's oceans. About 20 years ago, biologists developed the idea of what they called biodiversity hotspots. These are the areas which have the greatest mixture of species, so one example is Madagascar. These hotspots are significant because they allow us to locate key areas for focusing efforts at conservation. Biologists can identify hotspots on land fairly easily, but until recently, very little was known about species distribution and diversity in the oceans, and no one even knew if hotspots existed there. Then a Canadian biologist called Boris Worm did some research in 2005 on data on ocean species that he got from the fishing industry. Worm located five hotspots for large ocean predators like sharks and looked at what they had in common. The main thing he'd expected to find was that they had very high concentrations of food, but to his surprise that was only true for four of the hotspots. The remaining hotspot was quite badly off in that regard. But what he did find was that in all cases, the water at the surface of the ocean had relatively high temperatures, even when it was cool at greater depths. So this seemed to be a factor in supporting a diverse range of these large predators. However, this wasn't enough on its own because he also found that the water needed to have enough oxygen in it. So these two factors seemed necessary to support the high metabolic rate of these large fish. A couple of years later, in 2007, a researcher called Lisa Balance, who was working in California, also started looking for ocean hotspots, but not for fish. What she was interested in was marine mammals, things like seals. And she found three places in the oceans which were hotspots. And what these had in common was that these hotspots were all located at boundaries between ocean currents. And this seems to be the sort of place that has lots of the plankton that some of these species feed on. So now people who want to protect the species that are endangered need to get as much information as possible. For example, there's an international project called The Census of Marine Life. They've been surveying oceans all over the world, including the Arctic. One thing they found there, which stunned other researchers, was that there were large numbers of species which lived below the ice, sometimes under a layer up to 20 meters thick. Some of these species had never been seen before. They've even found species of octopus living in these conditions. And other scientists working on the same project, but researching very different habitats on the ocean floor, have found large numbers of species congregating around volcanoes, attracted to them by the warmth and nutrients there. However, biologists still don't know how serious the threat to their survival is for each individual species. So a body called the Global Marine Species Assessment is now creating a list of endangered species on land, so they consider things like the size of the population, how many members of one species there are in a particular place, and then they look at their distribution in geographical terms. Although this is quite difficult when you're looking at fish because they're so mobile, and then thirdly they calculate the rate at which the decline of the species is happening. So far only 1,500 species have been assessed, but they want to increase this figure to 20,000. For each one they assess, they use the data they collect on that species to produce a map showing its distribution. Ultimately they will be able to use these to figure out not only where most species are located, but also where they are most threatened. So finally, what can be done to retain the diversity of species in the world's oceans? Firstly, we need to set up more reserves in our oceans, places where marine species are protected. We have some, but not enough. In addition to preserve species such as leatherback turtles, which live out in the high seas, but have their nesting sites on the American coast, we need to create corridors for migration, so they can get from one area to another safely. As well as this, action needs to be taken to lower the levels of fishing quotas to prevent overfishing of endangered species. And finally, there's the problem of bycatch. This refers to the catching of unwanted fish by fishing boats. They're returned to the sea, but they're often dead or dying. If these commercial fishing boats used equipment, which was more selective, so that only the fish wanted for consumption were caught, this problem could be overcome.

short-stories-0128-129-working-in-my-yard.wav,Working in my yard. I live in a house that has a small yard around it. In my yard there is a lawn and a garden. There is also a sidewalk that leads to my front door and a driveway that leads to my garage. Throughout the year I work to maintain my yard. During the summer I cut the grass that grows in my yard using a lawn mower. I like the smell of the grass when it has just been cut but it's better not to cut the grass too short. When the weather is dry I also put water on the lawn and garden so that the grass and flowers can grow. During the autumn many leaves fall from the trees in my yard. I use a rake to collect the leaves from the lawn. Then I can put the leaves into bags. I can use the leaves to make fertilizer. When I was a kid I didn't like the job of raking leaves but now I don't mind it. Another job during the autumn is to remove flowers from the garden before cold weather arrives. During the winter there is no work to do in the lawn or garden because they are covered in snow. But I need to keep the snow off my sidewalk and driveway. Whenever it snows I use a shovel to clear the snow from a sidewalk and the driveway. Sometimes it snows a lot. If I didn't shovel the snow it would soon be impossible to get into my house. During the spring the snow melts. I clean up my yard by sweeping away the dirt and by removing weeds from the lawn and garden. I also put flowers back into the garden. It's nice to see them again after the long cold winter. When spring comes the grass grows very quickly so I need to cut the grass quite often. Working in the yard can be very satisfying work. It's so nice when the lawn and garden are looking green and healthy.,132.6498125,154.69301926076977,Fast
short-stories-0123-124-creative-people.wav,"Creative People Some people are just bored to create. That's what I think. Some people just have the need to write stories, compose beautiful music or paint pictures. Creativity seems to be inside them and they need to let it out. It's good that we have people like that. Composers like Mozart and Chopin have given us music that is incredibly beautiful. It's not just the classical composers who have given us great pieces of music. There are modern composers who have written great songs also. Elton John is an example of someone who has composed many wonderful songs. Andrew Lloyd Webber has given us some very popular musicals like Cats and the Phantom of the Opera. There are so many talented and creative people in this world. When you visit an art gallery, you marvel at how artists are able to recreate realism or make up something that seems totally unreal, yet beautiful. The American artist Norman Rockwell painted some pictures that actually look like photographs. He tried to portray life as it was in America. Through his paintings, one can get a good sense of American life through the years. On the other hand, artists like Jackson Pollock did not portray realism. Jackson Pollock painted abstract pictures. His paintings are just as good as Norman Rockwell's, but they are entirely different. Some books that we read are classics. Mark Twain portrayed American life through his characters Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. Charles Dickens brought Victorian England to life through his books. Most people are familiar with his Christmas Carol, where the mean and miserable Scrooge learns the true meaning of Christmas. People don't have to read the classics. There are modern writers who entertain readers through their stories. Stephen King has written a number of horror stories. Some of his books have even been made into movies. We are lucky to have creative people who share their gifts with us. If you are lucky enough to be creative, you should use your talents to create works of art that we can all share.

ielts-listening-0286-ielts-recent-actual-test-4-part-2.wav,"Welcome to the library or the ILC which means independent learning centre and let me explain about some of its facilities. We're standing here at the entry gates next to the borrowing desk. That's where you check out any books but you are also advised to study in the library here since most of our material cannot be borrowed. Thus we have seating along the middle of the library and in that far corner in front of us on the left we have the quiet reading section for some serious reading activity. We used to have the computers there but then realised that that corner was very quiet and thus better suited for the purpose it now has. The computers were instead shifted to a more central location, right beside us here on the left. Again somewhat confusingly this area once housed the newspaper and magazine section but the people in the quiet reading area had to walk too far to collect this literature so it was moved to right beside them in the adjacent corner. So feel free to read the newspapers there but the reference books, those huge weighty dictionaries, atlases and encyclopedias were all situated at the opposite end of the building against the wall. This was because they weren't generally that popular and we wanted more space for the magazine racks, always a favourite with readers. Okay as well as reading you need to work on your listening skills and for that you need the audio section. Again such an activity needs a quiet area so we put this in the last remaining corner up there on your right as you can see. There are CD players and headphones so just borrow the listening packs, sit down there and listen away. Right that just leaves the main library. In other libraries that's often right beside the newspaper and magazine section, allowing freedom to choose from all genres of literature but here we've got them further apart. For the main library just follow your nose, pass the central seating there and it's there among all that shelving upon which you'll find an abundance of interesting books and listening packs to use. Now I'd like to tell you a bit more about an excellent service offered in the ILC here that we call the special sessions. What can you do in them? For a start many of you need practice in speaking English and for that we hold a special discussion session led by a teacher. That can be noisy. In fact we hope that it is noisy since that would mean many people are talking. It's in the central seating area and it used to be from 1030 to 130 but we found that the noise was disturbing the regular ILC patrons so we shortened and moved this discussion to the morning 9am time slot when fewer people are in the centre. It goes for one and a half hours. Alright what about writing skills? Well we can help you there with another teacher. Now writing is a fairly quiet activity so that teacher stations him or herself in the quiet reading area from 130 until 3. The 1030 to midday time slot cannot have a teacher for such writing skills as they are all teaching in the morning. For this reason of course there cannot be an on call teacher in the morning either. Although many people would like one particularly the 1030 to noon crowd having just finished their early morning class. These students all have to wait until midday onwards when for three hours a teacher will be stationed in the audio section ready to deal with all those questions. Until recently we had another teacher doing the 3pm to 6pm time slot in the central seating but all the noise interfered with the late users of the ILC so we had to cancel that. Also noisy can be the language exchange where local students who want to learn your language will help you practice English. This is generally done in pairs so the noise level is low enough not to need this exchange to run at 9am but at the more congenial time of 1030 among the central seating. That must finish by 130 though after which quieter and more individual activities take place.",293.41875,147.43434085245065,Ideal

ielts-listening-0148-cam10-test-1-part-4.wav,"Today, we continue our series on ecology and conservation with a look at a particularly endangered member of the Black Bear family. One in ten Black bears is actually born with a white coat, which is the result of a special gene that surfaces in a few. Local people have named it the Spirit Bear, and according to the legends of these communities, but snowy fur brings with it a special power. Because of this, it has always been highly regarded by them, so much that they do not speak of seeing it to anyone else. It is their way of protecting it when strangers visit the area. The white bear's habitat is quite interesting. The bear's strong relationship with the old-growth rainforest is a complex one. The white bear relies on the huge, centuries-old trees in the forest in many ways. For example, the old-growth trees have extremely long roots that help prevent erosion of the soil along the banks of the many fish streams. Keeping these banks intact is important because these streams are home to salmon, which are the bear's main food source. In return, the bear's feeding habits nurture the forest. As the bears eat the salmon, they discard the skin and bones in great amounts on the forest floor, which provide vital nutrients. These produce lush vegetation that sustains thousands of other types of life forms from birds to insects and more. Today, the spirit bear lives off the coast of the province of British Columbia on a few islands. There is great concern for their survival, since it is estimated that less than 200 of these white bears remain. The best way to protect them is to make every effort to preserve the delicate balance of their forest environment. In other words, their ecosystem. The greatest threat to the bear's existence is the loss of its habitat. Over many years, logging companies have stripped the land by cutting down a large number of trees. In addition, they have built roads which have fractured the areas where the bear usually feeds, and many hibernation sites have also been lost. The logging of the trees along the streams has damaged the places where the bear's fish. To make matters worse, the number of salmon in those streams is declining because there is no legal limit on fishing at the moment. All these influences have a negative impact on the spirit bear's very existence, which is made all the more fragile by the fact that reproduction among these bears has always been disappointingly low. And so what's the situation going forward? Community organizations, environmental groups, and the British Columbia government are now working together on the problem. The government is now requiring logging companies to adopt a better logging method, which is a positive step. However, these measures alone may not be sufficient to ensure a healthy population of the spirit bear in the future. Other steps also need to be taken. While it is important to maintain the spirit bear's habitat, there also needs to be more emphasis on its expansion. The move is justified as it will also create space for other bears. They're losing their homes to them.",252.83075,126.7250917857104,Ideal

short-stories-0165-166-corruption.wav,"Corruption. When an official of a government or business is acting dishonestly, we say that this person is corrupt. Corruption is a serious problem in many countries around the world. There are several different kinds of corrupt practices, including bribes, kickbacks, nepotism, and embezzlement. A bribe is a payment of money or some other benefit in exchange for a decision that would not otherwise be made. For example, an accused criminal might bribe a judge so that the judge would make a decision of not guilty. Another example is that a business owner might bribe a government official so that the official would allow the construction of very unsafe buildings. A kickback is similar to a bribe, except that the official receives some part of the money in a dishonest business deal. For example, government sometimes decide which company should build a road. A company might offer money to a government official who makes the decision so that this company will be chosen, even if it's not the best company for the job. Nepotism happens when an official unfairly gives advantages to his or her relatives. For example, a government official might hire a brother or sister to do a job even though other people would be much better qualified for that job. Of course, all of us want to help our relatives, but it is wrong to do this at the expense of the public. Inbezzlement happens when an official secretly steals some money from a company or government. For example, a manager at a company might secretly move some of the company's money to his or her own bank account, and that manager might lie about his or her expenses in order to receive more payment from the company. Corruption has very bad effects on people in several ways. Sometimes it can lead to very dangerous situations. One example of this is when unsafe construction projects are approved by officials who have been robbed. Another example is when criminals are freed as a result of bribes. Also, a country's economy can be damaged by corruption. For example, if companies must pay bribes in order to do business, then they may decide to leave the country. Also, if people's tax money is stolen by corrupt officials, this makes the people poorer. In addition, when company officials are corrupt, it makes the company less able to compete with other companies. How can corruption be stopped? An important step is for each person to decide not to act in ways that are corrupt. People must agree to take this problem seriously. Also, each company and each government must have strict rules about corruption. It must be very clear to all employees from the lowest to the highest that corruption is totally unacceptable.",166.0343125,166.59207114192137,Fast

So today I want to talk about three key areas that will shape the future of artificial intelligence. In here we are talking about ethical AI, AI human collaboration and scalable architectures. So first let's discuss ethical AI. In here this involves creating rules and guidelines to ensure that AI is developed responsibly. So it's about making sure AI systems are fair, reduced, reduced buyers and transparents in their decision making. So in other words we need to know why AI makes that certain decisions and ensure those decisions are fair to everyone. So those about the ethical AI. So when we come to the AI human collaboration, this is about making AI work with paper, AI work better with paper. So we need to create that system that helps us make smarter decisions and work more efficiently. This includes deciding easy to use interfaces and making sure that AI can assist us in a way that feels natural and intuitive. So that is about AI human collaborations. So in the scalable and architectures, this is all about building AI systems that can grow and adapt as needed. So we need flexible cloud-based designs that can handle more data and users and also more complex tasks without any issues. So this is ensure that our needs and demands are grow and our AI system can keep up. So by focusing on these three areas, we can build trust in about AI, improve how we work with the network with AI and ensure that AI can continue to grow and evolve smoothly. So this is all about these three ethical AI and AI human collaboration and scalable AI architectures. Next move to the next slide. So let's explore three important areas that are key to dancing and improving artificial intelligence. So scalability in real world AI developments and automated machine learning and robust features representation. So India we are talking about that three features about how that help us to obtain knowledge in that AI conference. So in first scalability in real world deployments. So this means creating AI systems that can handle more data and more users and more complex tasks without showing down our down our crashing. So we are talking about making sure that our AI system can grow and keep working smoothly as demand in place. So in next automated machine learning, it is a simple wise the process of developing AI by automating task like choosing the right models and find during settings and prepare in data. With that with this sort of automated machine learning we can create that powerful AI system more quickly and easily even even if we are not AI experts, we can use that this automated machine learning. After that robust features representation. So this involves using advanced techniques to help AI models learn and adapt better to different tasks and environments. So techniques like domain invariant and learn itself, supervised learning and constructive learning make that AI models more flexible and effective across various real world application. So by focusing on these areas we can build AI system that is scalable and efficient and versatile and meeting the diverse needs to needs of real world application.

short-stories-0174-175-the-history-of-trial-by-jury.wav,"The History of Trial by Jury In most English-speaking countries, a person who is accused of a crime has the right to a trial by jury. In a trial by jury, the guilt or innocence of the accused person is decided by a group of 12 people called jurors who must listen to the evidence about the case. The idea of a trial by jury is over 800 years old, but there was a time when criminal cases were decided in other ways. Today, many of these methods seemed ridiculous and cruel. Many accused people were forced to undergo a trial by ordeal. There were several different kinds of this trial. For example, in the ordeal by fire an accused man was forced to carry a red hot piece of iron in his hand. People believed that if the man were innocent, then the gods would protect him, and his hand would not be burned or blistered by the iron. Another form of the trial by ordeal was the ordeal by combat. If one person accused another of a crime, they would be forced to fight each other with some weapon. People believed that the gods would help the man who was right and allow him to win the fight. Yet another kind of ordeal was the ordeal by water. If a woman was accused of a crime, such as witchcraft, she might be thrown into a river with rocks attached to her. People believed that the gods would help an innocent woman and allow her to float on the water. Gradually, people realized that the trial by ordeal was a completely worthless way to judge a person's innocence or guilt. They wanted a less barbaric way to decide criminal cases. During the 12th century, a new method was introduced by one of the kings of England, Henry II. Henry said that criminal cases should be decided by the opinions of twelve honest men who knew about the crime, the victim, and the accused person. This was the beginning of trial by jury in English-speaking countries, and the method soon became very popular. People trusted this new method much more than they trusted the old methods. Later, the system of trial by jury changed somewhat. Instead of having a jury of twelve men and women who knew about the crime, juries were chosen so that the twelve people did not know anything about the crime. This change ensures that the jurors do not have any bias or prejudice about the case. When jurors do not know any of the people involved in the case, their decisions are more likely to be fair and accurate. Today, citizens in many countries are called occasionally for jury duty. This can be inconvenient for people who are busy with their work and family life. However, many men and women are willing to serve on juries because of a feeling of responsibility to society. The use of juries in criminal cases helps to ensure that justice is done.",186.6710625,161.67476413222857,Fast

ielts-listening-0014-cam19-test-4-part-2.wav,"My name is Liz Fuller and I'm a running coach with Compton Park Ranners Club. Welcome to my podcast. If you're thinking about taking up running, I'm here to help. There are many training programmes available online, which aim to help people build up to running 5 kilometres. Some of them are great and thousands of people of all ages are taking part in 5 kilometre races across the country as a result. People like them because they're easy to follow and don't push them too hard. However, they don't work for everyone, especially if you suffer from something like a heart condition or asthma, because they're aimed at people with average fitness and running ability. Another thing is that everyone is different, and if you have any specific questions related to your needs, there's no one to provide any answers. I have a couple of simple tips I always give to new runners. I expect you've been told to run very slowly until your fitness increases. Well, I find that can prevent progress. You should run at a speed that feels comfortable, but time yourself and try to run a bit faster each time. Listening to music can be very helpful. It takes your mind off things and helps your body get into a rhythm. I'd say that is better than running with a friend, especially as most people are competitive, and that's not what you want when you're just starting. I don't think the time of day is especially important. Some people are better in the evening, while others are mourning people, but you need to be consistent, so aim to train regularly twice a week is enough to begin with. New members often say to me that they've been put off running either because they lack confidence, or they don't have time, or they think they dislike running. Carey, for example, joined the club two years ago at the age of 40. She'd always enjoyed running at school, but wasn't sure if she'd be able to do it. She was worried about being left behind and being the slowest runner, but she says she was made to feel so welcome. She soon forgot all about that. James had always hated the idea of running, but a friend encouraged him to come along for a taste of session and he hasn't looked back. He never misses a training session, despite having a really demanding job. Leo was worried about having to commit himself to training sessions every week, and wasn't sure he'd be able to fit training into his busy schedule. But after experiencing a lot of stress at work, he came along to us and gave it a go. Now he says he feels much more relaxed, and he looks forward to his weekly run. Mark is quite typical of our new members. He's never considered himself to be a sporty person, and it was only when he retired that he decided to take up the challenge of trying to run five kilometres. It took him months to find the courage to contact us, but felt reassured immediately, as there were other people his age, who were only just taking up running for the first time. My own journey hasn't been easy. I did my first marathon when I was 37, after having had two kids. My husband had been running marathons for years, but I never dreamed I'd be doing one with him. I managed to complete it in four hours, but I felt like giving up halfway through. It was only the support of the spectators that kept me going. I do think signing up for a race of what ever length is motivating, whether it's 5K or 25K, because it's good to have something to work towards, and it gives you a sense of achievement. I did my first 10K after only six months, which was certainly very challenging, and not something I'd necessarily recommend. But after you've been training for a few weeks, it's worth putting your name down for a 5K. Some people find they only need a few practice runs before taking part in a race, but I'd give yourself a couple of months at least. Well, I hope that's given you a really good idea of what...",281.2335,152.96897417981856,Fast

ielts-listening-0064-cam16-test-4-part-4.wav,"One of the most famous cases of extinction is that of a bird known as the dodo. In fact, there's even a saying in English, as dead as the dodo, used to refer to something which no longer exists. But for many centuries, the dodo was alive and well, although it could only be found in one place, the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. It was a very large bird, about one metre tall, and over the centuries it had lost the ability to fly, but it survived happily under the trees that covered the island. Then, in the year 1507, the first Portuguese ships stopped at the island. The sailors were carrying spices back to Europe and found the island a convenient stopping place where they could stock up with food and water for the rest of the voyage, but they didn't settle on Mauritius. However, in 1638 the Dutch arrived and set up a colony there. These first human inhabitants of the island found the dodo birds a convenient source of meat, although not everyone liked the taste. It's hard to get an accurate description of what the dodo actually looked like. We do have some written records from sailors and a few pictures, but we don't know how reliable these are. The best-known picture is a Dutch painting in which the bird appears to be extremely fat, but this may not be accurate. An Indian painting done at the same time shows a much thinner bird. Although attempts were made to preserve the bodies of some of the birds, no complete specimen survives. In the early 17th century, four dried parts of a bird were known to exist. Of these, three have disappeared. So only one example of soft tissue from the dodo survives a dodo head. Bones have also been found, but there's only one complete skeleton in existence. This single dodo skeleton has recently been the subject of scientific research, which suggests that many of the earlier beliefs about dodo's may have been incorrect. For example, early accounts of the birds mentioned how slow and clumsy it was, but scientists now believe the birds' strong knee joints would have made it capable of movement, which was not slow, but actually quite fast. In fact, one 17th century sailor wrote that he found the birds hard to catch. It's true that the dodo's small wings wouldn't have allowed it to leave the ground, but the scientists suggest that these were probably employed for balance while going over uneven ground. The group of scientists carried out analysis of the dodo's skull. They found that the reports of the lack of intelligence of the dodo were not born out by their research, which suggested the bird's brain was not small, but average in size. In fact, in relation to its body size, it was similar to that of the pigeon, which is known to be a highly intelligent bird. The researchers also found that the structure of the bird's skull suggested that one sense which was particularly well developed was that of smell. So the dodo may also have been particularly good at locating ripe fruit and other food in the island's thick vegetation. So it looks as if the dodo was better able to survive and defend itself than was originally believed. Yet, less than 200 years after Europeans first arrived on the island, they had become extinct. So what was the reason for this? For a long time it was believed that the dodo's were hunted to extinction. But scientists now believe the situation was more complicated than this. Another factor may have been the new species brought to the island by the sailors. These included dogs which would have been a threat to the dodo's and also monkeys which ate the fruit that was the main part of the dodo's diet. These were brought to the island deliberately, but the ships also brought another type of creature, rats, which came to land from the ships and rapidly overrun the island. These upset the ecology of the island, not just the dodo's but other species too. However, they were a particular danger to the dodo's because they consumed their eggs. And since each dodo only laid one at a time, this probably had a devastating effect on populations. However, we now think that probably the main cause of the bird's extinction was not the introduction of non-native species, but the introduction of agriculture. This meant that the forest that had once covered all the island and that had provided a perfect home for the dodo was cut down so that crops such as sugar could be grown. So although the dodo had survived for thousands of years, suddenly it was gone.",393.108125,121.64592120806459,Ideal
ielts-listening-0164-cam9-test-1-part-4.wav,"Good afternoon everyone. Well with some of you about to go out on field work, it's timely that in this afternoon session I'll be sharing some ideas about the reasons why groups of whales and dolphins sometimes swim ashore from the sea right onto the beach and most often die in what are known as mass strandings. Unfortunately, this type of event is a frequent occurrence in some of the locations that you'll be travelling to, where sometimes the tide goes out suddenly, confusing the animals. However, there are many other theories about the causes of mass strandings. The first is that the behaviour is linked to parasites. It's often found that stranded animals were infested with large numbers of parasites. For instance, a type of worm is commonly found in the ears of dead whales. These marine animals rely heavily on their hearing to navigate. This type of infestation has the potential to be very harmful. Another theory is related to toxins or poisons. These have also been found to contribute to the death of many marine animals. Many toxins, as I'm sure you're aware, originate from plants or animals. The whale ingests these toxins in its normal feeding behaviour, but whether these poisons directly or indirectly lead to stranding and death seems to depend upon the toxin involved. In 1988, for example, 14 humpback whales examined after stranding along the beaches of Cape Cod were found to have been poisoned after eating tuna that contained sacsy toxin, the same toxin that can be fatal in humans. Alternatively, it has also been suggested that some animals strand accidentally by following their prey ashore in the confusion of the chase. In 1995, David Thurston monitored pilot whales that beached after following squiddishore. However, this idea does not seem to hold true for the majority of mass strandings, because examination of the animal's stomach contents reveal that most had not been feeding as they stranded. There are also some new theories which link strandings to humans. A growing concern is that loud noises in the ocean cause strandings. Noises such as those caused by military exercises are of particular concern and have been pinpointed as the cause of some strandings of late. One of these, a mass stranding of whales in 2000 in the Bahamas, coincided closely with experiments using a new submarine detection system. There were several factors that made this stranding stand out as different from previous strandings. This led researchers to look for a new cause. For one, all the stranded animals were healthy. In addition, the animals were spread out along 38 km of coast, whereas it's more common for the animals to be found in a group when mass strandings occur. A final theory is related to group behaviour, and suggests that sea mammals cannot distinguish between sick and healthy leaders, and will follow sick leaders, even to an inevitable death. This is a particularly interesting theory, since the whales that are thought to be most social, the toothed whales, are the group that strand the most frequently. The theory is also supported by evidence from a dolphin stranding in 1994. Examination of the dead animals revealed that, apart from the leader, all the others had been healthy at the time of their death. Without one consistent theory, however, it is very hard for us to do anything about this phenomenon except to assist animals where and when we can. The networks have been established around the world to aid in rescuing animals and collecting samples from those that could not be helped. I recommend John Conner's Marine Mammals Assure, as an excellent starting point if you're interested in finding out more about these networks, or establishing one yourself.",265.0726875,141.01792362142177,Ideal

ielts-listening-0212-cam6-test-1-part-4.wav,"In the last few weeks we've been looking at various aspects of the social history of London, and this morning we're continuing with a look at life in the area called the East End. I'll start with a brief history of the district and then focus on life in the first half of the 20th century. Back in the first to the fourth centuries AD, when the Romans controlled England, London grew into a town of 45,000 people, and what's now the East End, the area by the River Thames and along the road heading north east from London to the coast, consisted of farmland with crops and livestock which helped to feed that population. The Romans left in 410 at the beginning of the 5th century, and from then onwards the country suffered a series of invasions by tribes from present-day Germany and Denmark, the Angles, Saxons and Juts, many of whom settled in the East End. The technology they introduced meant that metal and leather goods were produced there for the first time, and as the East End was by the river ships could transport goods between there and foreign markets. In the 11th century, in 1066 to be precise, the Normans conquered England, and during the next few centuries London became one of the most powerful and prosperous cities in Europe. The East End benefited from this, and because there were fewer restrictions there than in the city itself, plenty of newcomers settled there from abroad, bringing their skills as workers, merchants or moneylenders during the next few hundred years. In the 16th century the first dock was dug, where ships were constructed, eventually making the East End the focus of massive international trade, and in the late 16th century when much of the rest of England was suffering economically, a lot of agricultural workers came to the East End to look for alternative work. In the 17th century the East End was still a series of separate semi-rural settlements. There was a shortage of accommodation, so marshland was drained and built on to house the large numbers of people now living there. By the 19th century London was the busiest port in the world, and this became the main source of employment in the East End. These who could afford to live in more pleasant surroundings moved out, and the area became one where the vast majority of people lived in extreme poverty and suffered from appalling sanitary conditions. That brief outline takes us to the beginning of the 20th century, and now we'll turn to housing. At the beginning of the century living conditions for the majority of working people in East London were very basic indeed. Countries were crowded closely together, and usually very badly built, because there was no regulation. But the poor and needy were attracted by the possibility of work, and they had to be housed. It was the availability rather than the condition of the housing that was the major concern for tenants and landlords alike. Few houses had electricity at this time, so other sources of power were used like coal for the fires which heated perhaps just one room. Of course, the smoke from these contributed a great deal to the air pollution for which London used to be famous. A tiny, damp, unhealthy house like this might well be occupied by two full families, possibly including several children, grandparents, aunts and uncles. Now, before I go on to health implications of this way of life, I'll say something about food and nutrition.",217.9055,163.83248701845525,Fast

short-stories-0208-210-the-national-hockey-league.wav,"The National Hockey League The National Hockey League, or NHL, is the largest and most successful North American professional hockey league. The NHL provides Canadians and Americans with the highest caliber and most entertaining hockey on the continent. The NHL was created in 1917 by a group of Canadian and American businessmen. Their two central goals were to create a league that provided the most entertaining hockey in North America and generated revenues and profits. This was a somewhat new idea at the time, while there were some for profit, leagues and existence, most were amateur. This meant that players, coaches, and owners of teams were not allowed to make money from playing the game of hockey. It took several decades for the NHL to become the most dominant league. In the early days, a few professional or commercial leagues competed with the NHL for the public's entertainment dollar. Leagues competed vigorously for the best players in order to be successful and attract spectators and fans. While this was beneficial to players because they could command higher salaries, it was bad for business because owners expenses skyrocketed. As a result, many teams and leagues went bankrupt. By the 1930s, however, the NHL remained as the only major professional league in North America. This effectively kept players salaries down and reduced expenses. The NHL's team owners realized that in order for the league to be a successful commercial business, they would have to stop competing against each other off the ice. This was best accomplished by ensuring that only one major league existed so that competition was reduced. To this day, the same business model has followed, and the NHL is still the only major professional hockey league in North America. For several decades in the mid-20th century, the NHL owners were extremely successful financially. They generated very high profits because, having a monopoly in the hockey market, they could limit the sale and trade of players. When players signed onto a team, they generally did so for life and at the pay rate determined by the owner. Players were forced to accept these conditions because there were no other leagues in existence. This all changed in the 1970s when players organized a form of players union. Through the collective bargaining process, players gradually fought owners for higher pay and greater rights. Today, many players are very wealthy for this reason. If it was not for the players union, it is likely they would still be working in similar conditions to those during the early days of the NHL, low pay and little freedom to move from team to team. With NHL owners and players cooperating, the NHL continues to be the most successful and entertaining hockey league in North America. Teams across Canada and the United States compete for the prize Stanley Cup, the most sought after trophy in North American hockey.",176.5878125,163.77121156082046,Fast
ielts-listening-0152-cam10-test-2-part-4.wav,"Well, I've been talking to managers in a number of businesses and reading surveys about the future of management. And what I'm going to present in this seminar is a few ideas about how the activity is likely to change in the next 10 years. It isn't a scientific statistical analysis, just some ideas for us to discuss. One area I want to mention is business markets, and I'm sure a really significant development will be a major increase in competition, with companies from all around the world trying to sell similar products. Consumers will have much more choice. For instance, food products sold in Australia might be manufactured in the USA, China, Finland, and dozens of other countries. At the same time, mergers and takeovers mean that governments are actually losing power to major global corporations. They can probably all think of companies that exert a great deal of influence, which may be good for consumers. A third point I want to make about markets is that in the rapidly expanding economies, such as India, China, Brazil, and Russia, demand is growing very fast. This is putting pressure on resources all over the world. I think businesses are becoming more open to external influences. In particular, companies are consulting customers more and more before making their business decisions. Companies are finding out what they want and providing it, instead of making products and then trying to sell them, which is the model of years ago. Another influence is that concerns about the environment will force manufacturers to extend product life cycles to reduce the amount of pollution and waste. And in some cases, regulation will need to be strengthened. Many societies are much more fluid and democratic, and the structure of companies is changing to reflect that. I think we're going to see a greater emphasis within companies on teams created with a specific project in mind. And when they're completed, the teams will be disbanded and new ones formed. More and more people see work as simply one part of their lifestyle, and not the most important one. And as the workforce is shrinking in some countries, businesses are having to compete for staff instead of being able to choose among a lot of applicants. Typical examples that will attract and retain staff are traditional ones like flexible hours and something that has been made possible by advances in technology, remote working, with people based at their home, abroad, or almost anywhere they choose. Management styles will almost certainly continue to change. Senior managers will require a lot more than the efficiency that they've always needed. Above all, they'll need great skills and leadership so that their organization can initiate and respond to change in a fast-moving world where they face lots of competing requirements and potential conflicts. In most of the world, the senior managers of large businesses are mainly men in their fifties and sixties. The predominant style of management will almost certainly become more consultative and collaborative, caused, above all, by more women moving into senior management positions. Many of the changes are influenced by developments in the wider economy. The traditional emphasis of business was manufacturing, and of course the service sector is very important. But we shouldn't overlook the growing financial contribution of IP, that is, intellectual property. Some books and films generate enormous sums from the sale of related DVDs, music, games, clothes, and so on. Another point I'd like to make is that although I've been talking about companies, one trend that they have to face is the move away from people working for the same employer for years. Instead, more and more people are becoming self-employed to gain the freedom and control over their lives that they're unlikely to get from being employed. Okay, well, that's all I want to say. So let's open it up for discussion.",281.8956875,137.92335861824773,Ideal

Sometimes they learned the details of the damage that was done. They learn about what happened at 8.15am on August 6, 1945. People were eating breakfast. Children were going to school and adults going to work. There was a blinding flash of light, a scorching heat, and a mushroom cloud rose up. People close to the explosion were instantly vaporized. Many of those further away would die from burns and radiation. Sixty thousand houses were destroyed immediately. One concrete structure remained standing, although it was damaged. The local government left the atomic dome standing as a memorial to the explosion. Even those who were not seriously injured in the explosion later became very ill. They became very sick from radiation poisoning. Many developed leukemia. Sadako Sasaki was two years old when the bomb exploded. She was apparently un-injured and grew up normally until she was twelve. Then she developed leukemia, a disease of the blood and bone marrow. Sadako began to fold paper cranes to protect her from the illness. However, she died in 1955 before she reached one thousand paper cranes. Her example inspired the children's monument at Hiroshima. There is a peace museum in Hiroshima which has objects left by the explosion. These include bottles, metal, stones, and tiles twisted into strange shapes by the heat. There are objects on which people were vaporized so that their shape appears like a shadow on the material. There are bits of burnt clothing and many photographs. Why was the bomb dropped? World War II was a long and bitter war. The rules of war which said not to kill civilians were forgotten. Hitler bombed London, hoping to break the spirit of the English. Then England bombed Germany to destroy the factories and kill the people who worked in them. Americans wanted revenge for the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The US government had spent six billion dollars developing the A-Bomb and wanted to use it. Some say that they also wanted to warn the Russians not to cause trouble for America. When American forces advanced on Japan in 1945, they had to decide what to do. Would Japan surrender or would they fight to the last soldier? American leaders fear that they might lose many men by an invasion. Following the atomic bomb would end the war very quickly. President Truman made the decision to use it. Since then, most people have felt that this decision was wrong. It was such a terrible thing to do to people, children, old people, women, men, and babies. Hiroshima inspired many people to try to ban the bomb. They wanted to ensure that atomic bombs would not be used again. Then some of the scientists and air crews involved in making and dropping the bomb at Hiroshima wanted it banned. Perhaps if we can all remember what happened that day, there will be no more Hiroshima's.",205.6359375,145.59711869429438,Ideal
ielts-listening-0266-cam3-test-3-part-2.wav,"2. Welcome to the Sport Centre. It's good to see that there are so many people wanting to find out about our sports facilities. 1. Membership All students at the college are entitled to become members of the Sport Centre for an annual fee of £9.50. To register with us and get your membership card, you need to come to reception between 2 and 6pm Monday to Thursday. I'm afraid we can't register new members on Friday, so it's Monday to Thursday, 2 to 6 at reception. 2. Now, there are three things that you must remember to bring with you when you come to register. They are your union card, a recent passport-sized photograph of yourself and the fee. It doesn't matter whether you bring cash or check. We card issue your card unless you bring all three, so don't forget your union card, passport photo and fee. Then once you've got your sports card, you will need to bring it with you whenever you come to book or use any sport centre facilities. Booking over the phone is not allowed, so you have to come here in person with your card when you want to book. Our opening hours seem to get longer every year. We are now open from 9am to 10pm on weekdays and from 10am to 6pm on Saturdays. For those of you who are up and about early in the morning, we're introducing a 50% morning discount this year. This is because the facilities tended to be underused in the mornings last year. It means that all the sessions will be half price between 9am and 12 noon on weekdays. So, what exactly are the facilities? What sports can you play here? Well, this room we're in at the moment is called the main hall, and it's used mainly for team sports such as football, volleyball and basketball, but also for Badminton and aerobics. On the other side of the reception area there's the dance studio. This provides a smaller, more intimate space which we use for ballet, modern dance and martial arts, not at the same time, of course. Then in a separate building which you may have noticed on your way here, it's on the other side of the car park, there are the squash courts, six of them, and at the far end of the building a fitness room. This is our newest facility, only completed in the spring, but it's already proving to be one of the most popular. As well as all these facilities available here on the campus, we also have an arrangement with the local tennis club, which is only two miles away, entitling our students to use their courts on weekday mornings in the summer. So, I think that there should be something here for everybody, and I hope to see all of you at the centre, making use of the facilities. If in the course of the year you have any suggestions as to how the service we provide might be improved, or it's appeal widened, I'll be interested to hear from you.",204.1484375,152.24216447897135,Fast

As you can see on the screen now, with limited clarity in the playout, uses might have to struggle with the cramped arrangement of elements and lack of visual hierarchy, which can lead to confusion, especially when it comes to color reforms. So as you can see on the screen, they have not used a proper template to create the forms. And also they have not organized the entire page well. So my redesign page resolves these usability issues by introducing a modern pre-nan structure playout and now I'll show you. So as you can see on the screen now, this is the redesigned contact as page for the resuminable side. And the pastel color theme and the spacious design has enhanced their readability and the ease of navigation. Input fields such as name, email, contact number, message are clearly labeled. So once you have input all these required fields and click on the subject button, which is permanently placed, so improving calling, action, visibility. So you will redirected to the same page. Otherwise you will have to refill the form again and submit the form. So you can send whatever the message that you have to send to the company.

The streamlined approach ensures that users will have a more positive experience when gracing out to the company. Moving on, I'll take you through the redesigned DCP offers page for the resuminable side, comparing it with the existing version. So let's take a look at how it goes. To actually see on the screen now, the current racing of first page fields are rather minimally sticky design, but it lacks the clarity and structure needed for a smooth use experience. There is an excess of empty space, making the page fields pass and visually unengaging. Users may also experience confusion due to the lack of good rack-you feedback when sub-hitting information, which could lead to uncertainty but better their form was persist. My redesigned version addresses these issues by significantly reduce unnecessary empty spaces and recognizing the layout to provide a better clarity. The form fields are now neatly arranged. As you can see on the screen now, this is the redesigned vehicle racing of first page for the resuminable side. And users can easily feel in the required details without feeling overwhelmed by clutter. After users submit their details, they are redirected to the same page with the pop-up notification confirming their submission and a key enhancement that adds reassurance and improves user engagement. The new design is far more attractive with the modern aesthetic that incorporates better color contrast, structured typography and consistent spacing. This is not only enhances the overall look of the page, but also ensures a more positive and interactive user experience.

Going out to a restaurant is also fun because it allows a change from the usual routine of eating at home. There are many different kinds of restaurants. One popular type of restaurant is the fast food restaurant. When ordering fast food, you must first wait in line at the front of the restaurant and then order food from the counter. After paying, the food is quickly delivered and you can then take the food to a table where you can enjoy your meal. In most restaurants, you don't have to go to a counter to order your food. Instead, you are taken to a table soon after entering the restaurant. There, a waiter comes to give you a menu. You can choose your meal from the foods that are listed on the menu. After ordering, it takes some time to prepare your food. After a while, the waiter brings your meal to the table. When you are finished eating, the waiter brings the bill or check. You then pay for the meal and leave some extra money as a tip for the waiter. In some restaurants, the waiter does not bring the meal to your table. Instead, after you are taken to a table, you then go to a counter called a buffet. There, you can select different types of foods, such as salads, soups, meats, breads, vegetables, and desserts. After putting the food on your plate, you return to your table. After eating, you can return to the buffet to get more food. Other restaurants can be very fancy. They may have beautiful decorations, and they may have food that is prepared by expert chefs. These restaurants may also serve fine wines with the food. Of course, these restaurants are very expensive. At these restaurants, it is often necessary to reserve a table by telephoning the restaurant in advance. Different restaurants specialize in different kinds of food. Fast food restaurants may specialize in hamburgers or chicken. Some restaurants specialize in steak or seafood. Other restaurants specialize in foods that belong to a certain nationality. For example, many restaurants specialize in Italian, Mexican, Chinese, Indian, or Thai food.

rashmika_audio.wav,"Hello everyone, so I am going to talk about the overview of ML, DL, AI and big data. Next slide. Let's start with artificial intelligence. AI is the board field dedicated to creating systems that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence. Some common examples include speech recognition, decision making, visual perception, and learning translations. Next, we have machine learning, which is a subset of AI. ML focuses on developing algorithms that allows computers to learn from data and make predictions. Key techniques in ML include supervised learning, unsupposed learning, and trained for smart learning. Applications of ML are wide-ranging and include flat detection, recommendation systems, and predictive maintenance. Lastly, deep learning. DL is a specialized subset of ML. It issues neural networks with many layers known as deep neural networks to model complex patterns in data. The components of DL include neurons, layers, depth propagation, and activation functions. Applications of DL are found in image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous vehicles. Next slide. Now let's talk about big data and its role in AI and ML. First, what is big data? Big data refers to extremely large data set data to complex for traditional data processing tools to handle. These datasets are characterized by the five ways. This are volume that means the sheer amount of data, velocity, the speed at which data is generated and processed. And variety, the different types of data, both structured and unstructured, and velocity. The uncertainty or reliability of the data, lastly value. The insight and benefits derived from the data. Now we talk about roles in AI and ML. First one is data availability. Big data provides the huge amount of data necessary to train, accurate, and robust AI and ML models. Next, in our insights, it enables the discovery of patterns and insights that drive better decision-making and predictions. Lastly, scalability. Big data facilitates the development of scalable AI solutions that can handle real-time data, streams, and large scale applications. Let's talk about applications powered by big data. In health care, big data is used to personalize medicine and predictive analytics. In finance, it's a power-sphere time for detection and market analysis. In retail, it helps with customer behavior analysis and inventory management. In smart cities, it optimizes traffic management and energy usage. So these are about AI, ML, DL, and big data.

ielts-listening-0040-cam17-test-2-part-4.wav,"Write everyone, let's make a start. Over the past few sessions, we've been considering the reasons why some world languages are in decline, and today I'm going to introduce another factor that affects languages, and the speakers of those languages, and that's technology, and in particular digital technology. In order to illustrate its effect, I'm going to focus on the Icelandic language, which is spoken by around 321,000 people, most of whom live in Iceland, an island in the North Atlantic Ocean. The problem for this language is not the number of speakers, even though this number is small, nor is it about losing words to other languages such as English. In fact, the vocabulary of Icelandic is continually increasing, because when speakers need a new word for something, they tend to create one, rather than borrowing from another language. All this makes Icelandic quite a special language. It's changed very little in the past millennium, yet it can handle 21st century concepts related to the use of computers and digital technology. Take for example the word for web browser. This is Vafri in Icelandic, which comes from the verb to wander. I can't think of a more appropriate term, because that's exactly what you do mentally when you browse the internet. Then there's an Icelandic word for podcast, which is too hard to pronounce, and so on. Icelandic then is alive and growing, but, and it's a big part, young Icelanders spend a great deal of time in the digital world, and this world is predominantly English. Think about smart phones. They didn't even exist until comparatively recently, but today, young people use them all the time to read books, watch TV or films, play games, listen to music and so on. Obviously, this is a good thing in many respects, because it promotes their bilingual skills, but the extent of the influence of English in the virtual world is staggering, and it's all happening really fast. For their parents and grandparents, the change is less concerning, because they already have their native speaker skills in Icelandic, but for young speakers, well, the outcome is a little troubling. For example, teachers have found that playground conversations in Icelandic secondary schools can be conducted entirely in English, while teachers of much younger children have reported situations where their classes find it easier to say what is in a picture using English rather than Icelandic. The very real and worrying consequence of all this is that the young generation in Iceland is at risk of losing its mother tongue. Of course, this is happening to other European languages too, but while internet companies might be willing to offer say, French options in their systems, it's much harder for them to justify the expense of doing the same for a language that has a population the size of a French town, such as Nice. The other drawback of Icelandic is the grammar, which is significantly more complex than in most languages. At the moment, the tech giants are simply not interested in tackling this. So, what is the Icelandic government doing about this? Well, large sums of money are being allocated to a language technology fund that it is hoped will lead to the development of Icelandic sourced apps and other social media and digital systems, but clearly this is going to be an uphill struggle. On the positive side, they know that Icelandic is still the official language of education and government. It is survived for well over a thousand years, and the experts predict that its future in this nation state is sound and will continue to be so. However, there's no doubt that it's becoming an inevitable second choice in young people's lives. This raises important questions. When you consider how much of the past is tied up in a language, will young Icelanders lose their sense of their own identity? Another issue that concerns the government of Iceland is this.

There are many different ways of getting around the city, and we'd like to suggest some you may not have thought of. How about a city trip by boat? There are four main stopping points, from west to east, stop A, green banks, stop B, city bridge, stop C, Roman landing, and stop D, new town. You can find the main booking office at stop A. The first boat leaves at 8am and the last one at 6.30pm. There are also many attractions you can visit along the river. At stop A, if you have time, you can visit the fine 16th-century palace here, built for the king, with its beautiful formal gardens. It's very near the booking office. Now you can enjoy every corner of this superb residence. Stop B, why don't you visit Tower Restaurant, with its wide range of refreshments? This is a place where you can sit and enjoy the wonderful views over the old commercial and banking center of the city. Stop C is the area where in the first century AD invading soldiers crossed the river. This was much shallower than it is now. That's why this area is called Roman landing. There's an interactive museum to visit here, with a large shop, which has a good range of local history books. At the furthest point of the trip, stop D, the most exciting place to visit is the new entertainment complex, with seven screen cinema, bowling alley and video games arcade. Besides the boat tours, there are city buses. Two companies offer special services. The top bus company runs all its tours with a live commentary in English. These leave from 8.30am every 20 minutes.

short-stories-0117-118-how-to-avoid-catching-a-cold.wav,"How to avoid catching a cold How many colds do you catch in a year? Most of my friends catch quite a few colds. Becoff, sniffle and sneeze. They carry around tissues and blow their noses all the time. Their eyes water and they have scratchy throats. I don't get many colds. In fact, I can go for a whole year and never catch a cold. This is why I consider myself an expert on how not to catch a cold. I'll tell you how to avoid catching a cold. I think that you need to take a lot of vitamin C. I eat a lot of fruits and vegetables. I drink fruit juice too. I also take vitamin C pills. Whenever I begin to feel a cold coming on, I make sure that I have taken my vitamin C pill and I drink a lot of orange juice. That usually knocks the cold right out of my system. I make sure that I get a lot of fresh air. In the winter, a lot of buildings are shut up tight so that the air is stale and people's germs circulate through the buildings. I get outside and breathe in fresh, clean air. If somebody is rude enough to cough or sneeze right in front of me without covering his or her mouth, I just hold my breath for a second. I'm not sure if this works or not, but I don't want to breathe in anybody's cold germs. Many germs are passed through hands. It is important to wash your hands thoroughly if you touch anything in a public place. If I hold a banister while I'm walking down the stairs, I think of all the people who have used that banister. And I make sure that I wash my hands before I eat. Dornobbs also have a lot of germs on them. Money is another thing that is passed from hand to hand and is covered with germs. Sometimes I see people stick money into their mouths. Just think of all the germs that you would be putting into your mouth if you did that. If you just give it a little bit of thought, you can avoid a lot of germs that cause colds. If you eat good food and stay fit, your body will be able to fight off the germs that causes colds and other diseases. It is not always possible to avoid colds, but if you do catch a cold, drink plenty of fluids and get a lot of rest.",126.5894375,201.91258058161446,Fast

short-stories-0170-171-ice-hockey.wav,"Ice hockey. One of the most popular sports in northern countries is the Game of Ice hockey. Each winter, this sport is played by hundreds of thousands of children and adults in North America and in Europe. Ice hockey is a fast and exciting game that can make winter much more enjoyable. The Game of Ice hockey is played on a flat surface of ice called a ring. The ring is about 60 meters long and about 25 or 30 meters wide. At any time, each team has six players on the ice. On their feet, the players wear skates, whose thin metal blades allow fast movement along the ice surface. Learning to skate requires time and practice, but many people can skate very quickly and smoothly. In many ways, ice hockey is similar to soccer. However, unlike soccer, there is no large ball used in hockey. Instead, the players use a hard black rubber disc, which is called a puck. The players skate around the ice, trying to get the puck. They do not use their hands or feet to control the puck. Instead, they carry long wooden sticks, which are shaped in such a way that it is easy to push the puck along the ice. The players can pass the puck to each other by sliding it across the ice. To score a goal, a hockey player must shoot the puck into the net of the opposing team, but this is a difficult task. The net is less than two meters wide, and is protected by a player called the gold hinder. However, some players can shoot the puck very suddenly and with great power. Sometimes the sport of ice hockey can be quite rough. Players try to take the puck from their opponents by bumping into them at high speed. This is called a body check. Players are not allowed to hit each other with their sticks. If a player does this, then that player must be given a penalty by the referee, who enforces the rules of the game. Naturally, the sport of ice hockey is most popular in countries that have cold winters. Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and Germany. In addition, many people play hockey in the United States. In previous generations, ice hockey was considered a sport for men and boys only. However, in recent years, women and girls have been playing hockey much more frequently than in the past.

Located in the southwestern corner of the United States, California is home to a great diversity of natural environments and cultural influences. In the year 2000, over 33 million people lived in California. California's many mountains and valleys produce a wide variety of climates and natural regions. In the interior, southeastern parts of the state are many areas of desert. For example, death valley, which is so deep that it is below sea level, is extremely dry. Temperatures in death valley sometimes exceed 50 degrees Celsius. Other valleys are more pleasant and hospitable places. In the central valley, many farms grow vast amounts of fruits and vegetables. California also contains many tall, snow-covered mountains. On the slopes of some mountains are forests that have very large trees. Some of the giant redwood trees of California reach heights of 100 meters or more. Many of the cities in California have Spanish names. This is because many of those cities began as religious missions that were started by Spanish priests. Mexico owned California during the early 19th century, but few Mexican people lived there. The United States gained control of California during the 1840s and the discovery of gold brought many Americans and others to California. Today, California contains some of the largest cities in the United States. Within the greater Los Angeles area, one can find Hollywood, known as the movie Capital of the World. Many rich people live in suburbs such as Beverly Hills and many poor people live in other neighborhoods throughout the city. The Los Angeles area is home to over 15 million people, many of whom have immigrated to the United States from Mexico and from many Asian countries. Los Angeles is a very large city that has spread across a great area. As a consequence, the city has many traffic jams and air pollution or smog is sometimes a problem. Further north is the city of San Francisco, one of the most beautiful cities of the United States. The image of the Golden Gate Bridge, which crosses the harbor of San Francisco, is famous around the world. Also famous are the hilly streets of San Francisco and the trolley cars that provide transportation along them. San Francisco's Chinese community is one of the largest in North America and the city also contains a vibrant artistic and cultural life.

You don't have to dress up either. Students drop in wearing t-shirts and blue jeans and sit beside businessmen wearing suits and ties. Many coffee shops are open 24 hours a day, including Sundays and holidays. That way people who work at night or who have trouble sleeping can drop in at any time.

Many patrons have a favorite kind of coffee or other drink, and will drive past other coffee shops to go to one that serves the flavor they like. Visitors from other countries are often surprised at how roomy these coffee shops can be. Summer is large as regular restaurants, having a nice bit of space around them encourages people to relax.

Upon selecting a cashier unit, the system redirects to record the starting cash float for the day or the shift with multiple currencies. So, you can select a currency and enter the cashing amount to maintain the LKR cash float. And likewise, you can do the same for USD and may more.

After selecting the client type, it is a must to select a customer and agents and referrals are optional. You can also add a customer, agents and referrals here if the permissions are given to add them. And if the client type is employee, selecting an employee to complete an order process is necessary. So, once you select the customer, next is the discount restriction. So, only users with specific roles like managers so admins can apply discounts to the transactions. So once you click the key icon, you can give the email and the password. So once you submit it, you can type the discount here. It could be an amount or a percentage. So, you can also add coupon codes if there is a coupon generated.

This Open Air Museum gives you the experience of agriculture and rural life in the English countryside at the end of the 19th century. So you'll see a typical farm of that period, and like me, all the staff are dressed in clothes of that time. I must give you some advice and safety tips before we go any further. As it's a working farm, please don't frighten or injure the animals. We have a lot here, and many of them are breeds that are now quite rare. And do stay at a safe distance from the tools. Some of them have sharp points, which can be pretty dangerous, so please don't touch them. We don't want any accidents, do we? The ground is very uneven, and you might slip if you're wearing sandals, so I'm glad to see you're all wearing shoes. We always advise people to do that. Now children of all ages are very welcome here, and usually even very young children love the ducks and lambs, so do bring them along next time you come. I don't think any of you have brought dogs with you, but in case you have, I'm afraid they'll have to stay in the car park unless they're guide dogs. I'm sure you'll understand that they could cause a lot of problems on a farm. Now let me give you some idea of the layout of the farm. The building where you bought your tickets is the new barn immediately to your right, and we're now at the beginning of the main path to the farmland, and of course the car park is on your left. The scarecrow you can see in the car park in the corner beside the main path is a traditional figure for keeping the birds away from crops, but our scarecrow is a permanent sculpture. It's taller than a human being, so you can see it from quite a distance. If you look ahead of you, you'll see a maze. It opposite the new barn beside the side path that branches off to the right just over there. The maze is made out of hedges which are too tall for young children to see over them, but it's quite small so you can't get lost in it. Now can you see the bridge crossing the fish pool further up the main path? If you want to go to the cafe, go towards the bridge and turn right just before it. Walk along the side path and the cafes on the first bend you come to. The building was originally the schoolhouse and it's well over a hundred years old. As you may know we run skills workshops here where you can learn traditional crafts like woodwork and basket making. You can see examples of the work and talk to someone about the courses in the black barn. If you take the side path to the right here just by the new barn, you'll come to the black barn just where the path first bends. Now I mustn't forget to tell you about picnicking as I can see some of you have brought your lunch with you. You can picnic in the field though do clear up behind you of course. Or if you'd prefer a covered picnic area there's one near the farm yard just after you cross the bridge. There's a covered picnic spot on the right. And the last thing to mention is Fiddy House itself. From here you can cross the bridge then walk along the footpath through the field to the left of the farm yard. That goes to the house and it'll give you a lovely view of it. It's certainly worth a few photographs but as it's a private home I'm afraid you can't go inside. Right, well if you're already we'll set off on our tour of the farm.",259.963125,151.63689080903302,Fast
ielts-listening-0016-cam19-test-4-part-4.wav,"Tree planting now dominates political and popular agendas, and is often presented as an easy answer to the climate crisis, as well as a way for business corporations to offset their carbon emissions. But unfortunately, tree planting isn't as straightforward as some people think. When the wrong trees are planted in the wrong place, it can do considerably more damage than good, failing to help either people or the environment. Reforestation projects are currently being undertaken on a huge scale in many countries, and it's crucial that the right trees are selected. A mix of species should always be planted, typical of the local natural forest ecosystem, and including rare and endangered species, in order to create a rich ecosystem. It's important to avoid non-native species that could become invasive. Invasive species are a significant contributor to the current global biodiversity crisis, and are often in competition with native species and may threaten their long-term survival. Restoring biodiversity that will maximize carbon capture is key when reforesting an area, but ideally any reforestation project should have several goals. These could include selecting trees that can contribute to wildlife conservation, improve the availability of food for the local community, and maintain the stability of soil systems. Meeting as many of these goals as possible, whilst doing no harm to local communities, native ecosystems, and vulnerable species, is the sign of a highly successful tree planting scheme. To ensure the survival and resilience of a planted forest, it's vital to use tree seeds with appropriate levels of genetic diversity. The amount of genetic variation found within a species is essential for their survival. Using seeds with low genetic diversity generally lowers the resilience of restored forests, which can make them vulnerable to disease and unable to adapt to climate change. Choosing the right location for reforestation projects is as important as choosing the right trees. Ultimately, the best area for planting trees would be informally forested areas that are in poor condition. It's better to avoid non-forested landscapes, such as natural grasslands, savannas, or wetlands, as these ecosystems already contribute greatly to capturing carbon. It would also be advantageous to choose an area where trees could provide other benefits, such as recreational spaces. Reforesting areas which are currently exploited for agriculture should be avoided, as this often leads to other areas being deforested. Large-scale reforestation projects require careful planning. Making the right decisions about where to plant trees depends on having the right information. Having detailed and up-to-date maps, identifying high priority areas for intervention is essential. Drone technology is a useful tool in helping to prioritize and monitor areas of degraded forest for restoration. In Brazil, it's being used to identify and quantify how parts of the Amazon are being devastated by human activities, such as rearing cattle and illegal logging. A good example of where the right trees were picked to achieve a restored forest is in Lampang province in Northern Thailand. A previously forested site which had been degraded through mining was reforested by a cement company, together with Chang Mai University. After spreading 60cm of topsoil, they planted 14 different native tree species, which included several species of fig. Figs are a keystone species because of the critical role they play in maintaining wildlife populations. They are central to tropical reforestation projects as they accelerate the speed of the recovery process by attracting animals and birds which act as natural seed dispersers. This helps to promote diversity through the healthy regrowth of a wide range of plant species. Unlike the majority of fruit trees, figs bear fruit all year round, providing a reliable food source for many species. At this site, for example, after only three rainy seasons, monkeys started visiting to eat the fig fruits, naturally dispersing seeds through defecation. Reforestation projects should always aim to make sure that local communities are consulted and involved in the decision-making process. The restoration of mangrove forests in Madagascar is an example of a project which has succeeded in creating real benefits for the community. Destruction of the mangrove forests had a terrible impact on plant and animal life, and also badly affected the fishing industry, which was a major source of employment for local people living in coastal areas. The reforestation project involved hiring local people to plant and care for the new mangrove trees. Millions of mangrove trees have now been planted, which has resulted in the return of a healthy aquatic ecosystem. The mangroves also act as a defense against the increased threat of flooding caused by climate change. What's more, the local economy is more stable, and thousands more Madagascans are now able to send their children to school. One other important point to consider.",427.794875,110.66051223731935,Ideal

ielts-listening-0008-cam19-test-2-part-4.wav,"For my project on invertebrates I chose to study tardigrades. These are microscopic or to be more precise near microscopic animals. There are well over a thousand known species of these tiny animals which belong to the phylum tardigrada. Most tardigrades range in length from 0.05 to 1mm, though the largest species can grow to be 1.2mm in length. They are also sometimes called water bears, water because that's where they thrive best, and bear because of the way they move. Moss Piglet is another name for tardigrades because of the way they look when viewed from the front. They were first discovered in Germany in 1773 by Johann Gertzer, who coined the name tardigrada. As I say, there are many different species of tardigrades. Too many to describe here, but generally speaking, the different species share similar physical traits. They have a body which is short and also rounded, a bit like a barrel, and the body comprises four segments. Each segment has a pair of legs, at the end of which are between four and eight sharp claws. I should also say that some species don't have any claws, what they have are discs, and these work by means of suction. They enable the tardigrade to cling onto surfaces or to grip its prey. Within the body, there are no lungs or any organs for breathing at all. Instead, oxygen and also blood are transported in a fluid that fills the cavity of the body. As far as the tardigrades' head is concerned, the best way I can describe this is that it looks rather strange, a bit squashed even. Though many of the websites I looked at described its appearance as cute, which isn't exactly very scientific. The tardigrades' mouth is a kind of tube that can open outwards to reveal teeth-like structures known as stylets. These are sharp enough to pierce plant or animal cells. So, where are tardigrades found? Well, they live in every part of the world in a variety of habitats, most commonly on the bed of a lake, or on many kinds of plants or in very wet environments. There's been some interesting research which has found that tardigrades are capable of surviving radiation and very high pressure, and they're also able to withstand temperatures as cold as minus 200 degrees centigrade, or highs of more than 148 degrees centigrade, which is incredibly hot. It has been said that tardigrades could survive long after human beings have been wiped out, even in the event of an asteroid hitting the earth. If conditions become too extreme and tardigrades are at risk of drying out, they enter a state called cryptobiosis. They curl into a ball called a ton, that's TUN, by retracting their head and legs, and their metabolism drops to less than 1% of normal levels. They can remain like this until they're reintroduced to water, when they will come back to life in a matter of a few hours. While in a state of cryptobiosis, tardigrades produce a protein that protects their DNA. In 2016, scientists revived two tardigrades that had been tons for more than 30 years. There was a report that, in 1948, a 120-year-old ton was revived, but this experiment has never been repeated. There are currently several tests taking place in space to determine how long tardigrades might be able to survive there. I believe the record so far is 10 days. Moving on, in terms of their diet, tardigrades consume liquids in order to survive. Although they have teeth, they don't use these for chewing. They suck the juices from moss or extract fluid from seaweed. But some species prey on other tardigrades, from other species, or within their own. I suppose this isn't surprising, given that tardigrades are mainly comprised of liquid and are coated with a type of gel. Finally, I'd like to mention the conservation status of tardigrades. It is estimated that they have been in existence for approximately half a billion years, and, in that time, they have survived five mass extinctions. So it will probably come as no surprise to you that tardigrades have not been evaluated by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and are not on any endangered list. Some researchers have described them as thriving. Does anyone have any questions they'd like to ask?",335.0493125,130.1897910923187,Ideal

ielts-listening-0202-cam7-test-3-part-2.wav,"Good morning. I am very pleased to have been invited along to your club to talk about our charity sponsored Walking Holiday for Education Aid. I'll start by giving you a brief overview of what it entails. First of all, let me explain what we mean by sponsored here. This is where people promise to donate money to the charity if you achieve your goal. In this case, to walk a certain number of miles. Basically, we are organizing a 10-day holiday from the 6th to the 16th of November, with eight days actual walking, trekking in the Samir mountains. Let's have a look at some of the details. We require you to raise sponsorship money of at least $3,200, paying $250 of it up front as a deposit, and the rest in stages throughout the year. Out of this, about 35% will go on your expenses, and that leaves 65% guaranteed to go to the charity. Which brings me to the most important part. This trek is being specifically organised to help education in the Samir region. Last year, we helped train teachers for the disabled, and this year we are focusing on the pupils. Each of the walkers' sponsorship money will go to help an individual special needs pupil in one of the mountain schools. In the second part of the talk, I'll be giving you a lot more details. But back to the basic information. Age Limits. This is the second time we've run this kind of holiday, and on the first we even had an 80-year-old, but we found it was wise to establish limits this time. You have to be at least 18, at the top limit is now 70, though you need to obtain a health certificate from your doctor if you are over 60 years old. Now, the Samir mountains are among the highest in the world, but you mustn't be too daunted, we will mainly be trekking in the foothills only, although there will be spectacular views even in the foothills. However, you will need to be extremely fit if you aren't now, and you're interested in coming with us. You have plenty of time to get into shape. You'll be sleeping intense, so you must have quite a bit of equipment with you, but you will be held by local assistance. Your bedding and so forth will be carried by them. We ask that you only walk with a small rucksack with needs for the day. I don't think I've really said enough about the marvellous area you'll be walking in. Let's have a look at some of the sights you'll be seeing. Apart from these spectacular snow-covered peaks and valleys, there are marvellous historic villages, the area has been famous for centuries for making beautiful carpets, although recently there has been a trend to move into weaving blankets and wood carving. The people are extremely friendly and welcoming. We deliberately keep the parties small in size to minimise disruption to people and landscape. I hope that there are still some people interested. I will be distributing leaflets at the end where you can find out more information, but just for the moment I'll outline the itinerary, the main high points of the holiday. Obviously you'll start by flying out to Kishpa, the capital city on day one. After a couple of days to acclimatise yourself, you'll start the trek on day three, walking through the enormous Katibe forest, which will take the whole of the day. Day four takes us higher up, going through the foothills past a number of villages and visiting a school for the disabled in Sohan. Then you have a rest day, that's day five, before going to the spectacular Qumi temple, with twelve century carvings, set in a small forest by a lake, and that's day six, the highlight for many. We stay near there for day seven, because then comes the hardest day, walking through very mountainous country, but culminating in a swim in the Pate Falls. This is the highest waterfall in the region. Day nine is much easier, with part of the day spent in a village where they make some of the gorgeous red blankets. Then back down to Kishpa and the journey home. So, you can see it's a pretty packed timetable.",260.263625,166.44661734808312,Fast

To start your visit, I'm just going to give you a brief account of the history of the museum before letting you roam about on your own. I won't keep you long, okay? Now, from where we're standing, you've got a good view of the river over there. And it was because of this fast-flowing water that this site was a natural place for manufacturing works. The water and the availability of raw materials in the area like minerals and iron ore, and also the abundance of local fuels like coal and firewood, all made this site suitable for industry from a very early time. Water was the main source of power for the early industries, and some of the water wheels were first established in the twelfth century, would you believe. At that time, local craftsmen first built an iron forge just behind the village here on the bend in the river. By the 17th and 18th centuries, the region's rivers supported more than 160 water mills, and many of these continued to operate well into the 19th century. But then the steam engine was invented, and then the railways came, and the centres of industry were able to move away from the rivers and the countryside and into the towns. So industrial villages like this one became very rare. So that's the history for you. If you'd like any more information, you can ask me some questions, or you can read further in our excellent guidebook. Now, I'm going to give you a plan of the site, and I'd just like to point out where everything is, and then you can take a look at everything for yourself. I've already pointed out the river, which is on the left, and of course, running along the bottom is Woodside Road. Got it? Okay, now we're standing at the entrance. See it at the bottom, and immediately to our right is the ticket office. You won't need that, because you've got your group booking, but just past it are the toilets. Always could to know where they are. In front of us is the car park, as you can see, and to the left by the entry gate is the gift shop. That's where you can get copies of the guide like this one here. Now, beyond the car park, all the buildings are arranged in a half circle with a yard in the middle. The big stone building at the top is the main workshop. That's where the furnaces, and where all the metal was smelted, and the tools were cast, as you'll be able to see. Now, in the top right hand corner, that building with bigger windows is the showroom, where samples of all the tools that were made through the edges are on display. In the top left corner is the grinding shop, where the tools were sharpened and finished. And on one side of that, you can see the engine room, and on the other is the cafe, which isn't an antique, you'll be pleased to know, though they do serve very nice old-fashioned teas. The row of buildings you can see on the left are the cottages. These were built for the workers towards the end of the 18th century, and they're still furnished from that period, so you can get a good idea of ordinary people's living conditions. Across the yard from them, you can see the stables, where the horses were kept for transporting the products, and the separate building in front of them is the works office, and that still has some of the old accounts on display. Right, if anyone wants a guided tour, then I'm starting at the engine room. If you'd like to come along this way, please, ladies and gentlemen.",243.1123125,158.44528647638938,Fast

ielts-listening-0118-cam12-test-2-part-2.wav,"Right, I've now almost succeeded in finalising plans for our tour, so I'll bring you up to date with what I know. As you know, we're flying first to Munich, on Monday the 4th. The flight is at 11.30, so it's too early to have lunch at the airport. I suggest we meet there for coffee at 10, which should give us plenty of time for breakfast before we leave home. When we arrive in Munich, we'll be met at the airport by Klaus Bar. Klaus works for a tour operator, and he'll look after us for the time we'll be in Germany. He's already liaised with the managers of the theatres we're going to visit, and he's also arranged for an officer of the National Theatre in Munich to show us around the theatre one afternoon during our stay. Now, last time we discussed this trip, I didn't have the precise cost for hotel rooms, but now I have. The normal rate at the hotel where we're staying is 150 euros a night for a double room. I'd hoped to get that down to 120 euros, but in fact I've been able to negotiate a rate of 110. That'll be reflected in the final payment, which you'll need to make by the end of this week. On Tuesday, the day after our arrival, I had hoped we could sit in on a rehearsal at one of the theatres, but unfortunately that's proved very difficult to arrange. So instead we'll have a coach trip to one of the amazing castles in the mountains south of Munich. On Tuesday evening we'll all have dinner together in a restaurant near our hotel. From talking to you all about your preferences, it was clear that a typical local restaurant would be to meet oriented for some of you. Some of you suggested an Italian restaurant, but I must confess that I decided to book a Lebanese one as we have plenty of opportunities to go to an Italian restaurant at home. On Wednesday afternoon, the director of the play we're going to see that evening will talk to us at the theatre. She'll describe the whole process of producing a play, including how she chose the actors, and as the play we're going to see is a modern one how she worked with the playwright. Right, now I'd just like to make a few points about the plays we're going to see, partly because it might influence your choice of clothes to take with you. The play we're seeing on Wednesday evening is a modern one, and we're going to the premiere, so it'll be quite a dressy occasion, though of course you don't have to dress formally. I gather it's rather a multimedia production with amazing lighting effects and a soundtrack of electronic music, though unfortunately the playwright is ill and is unlikely to be able to attend. On Thursday we're seeing a play that was first performed last year when it was commissioned to mark a hundred years since the birth in the town of a well-known scientist. We're going to see a revival of that production, which aroused a lot of interest. Friday's play will really make you think hard about what clothes to pack, as it'll be in the garden of a palace. It's a beautiful setting, but I'd better warn you, there won't be much protection from the wind. On Saturday we're going by coach to a theatre in another town, not far from Munich. This will be the opening of a drama festival, and the mayor and all the other dignitaries of the town will be attending. After the performance the mayor is hosting a reception for all the audience, and there'll be a band playing traditional music of the region. And after having a day off on Sunday our final play is on Monday, and it's in the stunning setting of the Old Town Hall, which dates back to the 14th century. The performance marks the 50 years that the lead actor has been on stage, and the play is the one where he made his first professional appearance all those years ago.

ielts-listening-0280-ielts-recent-actual-test-2-part-4.wav,"In the night sky, the stars appear to revolve around the earth, rising in the east and disappearing in the west. The earth itself seems solid, fixed and stable, and such common sense perception suggests that the earth is the centre of the universe. This is known as geocentrism, with geomeaning earth, and all pre-modern civilizations drew this conclusion. We now know, of course, that the earth revolves around the sun, and this is called heliocentrism, with heliomeaning sun. But historically, it took quite a while for this to be deduced. As early as the 3rd century BC, an ancient Greek astronomer, Aristarchus of Samos, proposed heliocentrism, but received little support from his peers. Similarly, throughout subsequent history, isolated individuals proposed this new idea, but again, no one was listening. Geocentrism just seemed too logical to refute. Geocentrism also fitted the views of the established Christian church, who could quote biblical passages such as, the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved. Those who dared disagree were subject to accusations of heresy, often with dire punishments to follow. The trouble was, as the night sky was observed more closely, that simple revolution of the stars proved not so simple at all. In relation to the other stars, some steadily wanted in given directions, then sometimes reversed for months, and disappeared altogether. They were called planets, meaning wanderers. In addition, the position of the sun and moon altered slightly over the year, and comets, those mysterious glowing spots, would come and go. In order to predict the motion of the planets, and accurately serve the primary purpose of navigation for sailing ships, increasingly elaborate mathematical models were needed, a sure sign that something was not quite right. Heliocentrism, or the belief that the sun is the centre of the solar system, still needed a mathematically sound description before it could be scientifically accepted, and it was a Polish astronomer, Nicholas Copernicus, who in 1543 first published this. This event is sometimes referred to as the Copernican Revolution. Copernicus himself certainly feared the consequences of his proof, knowing full well it might invoke the anger of the established Church. Probably for this reason, he waited until the last year of his life, when he was sick and dying, to release his findings. In addition, the preface of the book, written by a respected member of the Church, stated that the model was not necessarily correct. As a result of this, there was no revolution whatsoever. In fact, the book received scant attention in the subsequent decades, apart from a few irate clergymen who angrily dismissed the whole scheme as irrelevant. Yet the following generations of astronomers did not always fare so well. The Italian scientist Galileo got into trouble, as did a fellow Italian with the surname Bruno, Giordano Bruno, who was burned at the stake, yet ultimately nothing could slow the spread of heliocentrism across Europe. It formed the basis of Isaac Newton's great work on the motion of the planets, a work which implied that even the sun around which the earth circled was itself in motion around a common center of gravity. No discourse about heliocentrism could finish without mentioning that, somewhat unbelievably, there still exists those today who choose to believe that the earth is the center of the universe. Modern geocentrism is usually the result of literal interpretations of the Bible, which is the cornerstone of these people's beliefs. They, therefore, also believe in creationism, that is, that a god created everything, and while we may smile at this, it is sobering to consider that surveys have revealed that up to 10% of British people, 12% of Europeans, 20% of the USA, and 25% of the Middle East still hold the belief that the sun revolves around the earth. One can only wonder what Copernicus would have thought of this.",297.1078125,130.45769370335893,Ideal
sammani_speech_01.wav,"Good morning everyone. Today let's talk about one of the smallest yet most powerful words in the English language. No, it's just two letters but for many of us saying it feels harder than climbing a mountain. Why is that? We live in a culture that rewards yes, yes, yes to overtime, yes to another favour, yes to weak and planned so don't you don't want but behind every forced yes is a burnt outso. I've been there overwhelmed and over committed because I didn't want to disappoint someone. Saying no doesn't mean you are selfish, it means you value your time, your energy and your boundaries. It's an act of self-respect. If your schedule is full of things that matter to everyone but you, what kind of life are you really building? Learning to say no helps you say yes to a truly matters, your goals, your rest, your people, it gives you back control. The truth is people might be disappointed when you say no. But they'll get over it and the ones who don't they probably never respected your boundaries in the first place. So the next time someone asks something of you and your gut screams no, listen, say it kindly but firmly, no isn't rejection, it's protection. Thank you.",132.6066875,96.8276958128526,Slow
short-stories-0148-149-thanksgiving.wav,"Thanksgiving. An important holiday in North America is held during the fall or autumn season of the year. This holiday is called Thanksgiving. At this time of year people join with their relatives to reflect upon their good fortune. Thanksgiving is a holiday that has a long history in North America. It was first celebrated when English settlers arrived in the eastern part of what is now the United States during the 17th century. When they survived the first hard year they celebrated and gave thanks to God. They invited some of the native people to their Thanksgiving celebration because the native people had helped them to survive during the hard winter. The tradition of celebrating Thanksgiving continued and spread throughout North America. Each fall during the time of the autumn harvest people celebrated Thanksgiving. They gave thanks for the food of the harvest and for all the good things in their lives. Today the tradition of Thanksgiving celebration continues. Families gather to eat a large bird called a turkey. They also eat pumpkin pie. This is a sweet dessert that is made from a large orange vegetable that grows on the ground. In the United States Thanksgiving is celebrated on the 4th Thursday of November. But the following day, Friday, is also a holiday and then comes the weekend. In Canada Thanksgiving is celebrated on the 2nd Monday of October. The reason for the earlier celebration in Canada is that the weather is colder than in the United States. This means that the harvest happens earlier in Canada. So Thanksgiving is held at an earlier date. But in both countries Thanksgiving is a very pleasant time of year.",121.730625,137.51675061226376,Ideal

short-stories-0193-194-modern-engineering-wonders.wav,"Modern Engineering Wonders During the 20th century, there were great improvements in engineering technology. These new developments allowed the construction of many amazing tunnels, bridges, towers and office buildings. For centuries, people had dreamed about the possibility of connecting the island of Great Britain to the mainland of Europe. However, it was only in 1994 that such a link was completed when a tunnel was dug under the English Channel between England and France. The channel tunnel also known as the channel actually consists of three separate railway tunnels. These tunnels are about 50 kilometers long. They are located about 150 meters below the bottom of the sea. Obviously, this was an extremely challenging project to undertake. As a result of the tunnel, it is now possible to travel between London and Paris by train. And the trip takes only three hours, of which only 20 minutes are spent inside the tunnel. A suspension bridge is a bridge that is supported by strong wires that hang from tall towers. The world's longest suspension bridge is the Akashi Kaiko Bridge near the city of Kobe, Japan. This bridge is nearly four kilometers long and the two towers near the middle of the bridge are about two kilometers apart. It took almost 20 years to design this bridge and ten years to build it. This bridge was designed to withstand extremely strong winds because Japan often experiences windstorms called typhoons. The bridge was also designed to withstand powerful earthquakes, which sometimes hit Japan. At the beginning of the 21st century, the world's tallest free-standing tower was the Canadian National Tower or the CN Tower. The CN Tower is 553 meters tall, is located in the city of Toronto within the Canadian Province of Ontario. The structure was built in 1975 as a television and radio tower. Before the CN Tower was built, TV and radio reception in the Toronto area was poor. This was because the TV and radio signals were blocked by the buildings of downtown Toronto. When the CN Tower was built, this problem was solved. Of course, the CN Tower is also a famous tourist attraction. People can ride in the very fast elevators that take them to observation areas which are at about 350 and 450 meters above the ground. Although the CN Tower is the world's tallest tower, it is not an office building. The tallest buildings in the world are the Petronas Towers in the city of Coalalum, poor Malaysia, and the Sears Tower in the American city of Chicago. The Sears Tower, which is 442 meters tall, was completed in 1974. It has 110 floors, and its top floor is the highest office floor in the world. However, the Petronas Towers reached slightly higher to a height of 452 meters. The Petronas Towers were completed in 1998. Obviously, the late 20th century witnessed some amazing achievements of engineering. It will be very interesting to see what new wonders will be constructed in the 21st century.",194.0375625,154.60923964142253,Fast
short-stories-0227-229-newspapers.wav,"Newspapers All the great cities in the world now have newspapers, but newspapers, as we know them today, are not that old. The very first newspapers began long after the invention of printing. They started in Europe in the 1600s, and were usually only a couple of pages long. For a long time, newspapers were not very common. Posts didn't want public discussion of their policies and decisions. Often they closed down papers or taxed them heavily. The stamp tax on newspapers and pamphlets was one of the causes of the American Revolution. Newspapers began to grow in size when they discovered advertising as a source of income. Nowadays advertising is the main revenue source for most newspapers. As newspapers became more widely circulated, they could ask for more money for their advertisements. By the late 18th century, newspapers were in common use in Europe. The 1800s and early 1900s was the golden age of newspapers, improvements in transportation, communication, and printing processes made it easier to collect news from near and far and to publish papers more quickly and more cheaply. The weekly dispatch and the times both of London, England, were leading newspapers through much of the 1800s. The times was one of the first papers to include illustrations. It was the first newspaper to use a steam engine to turn the presses. When the tax on newspapers was reduced in 1836, the times was able to increase its size considerably. In 1840, it began to use the telegraph to collect news stories. In 1855, the tax on newspapers was finally lifted. The times made its greatest reputation during the Crimean War between Britain and Russia. British armies fighting in Russia's Crimean Peninsula were not only unsuccessful in the war, but were suffering severely from illnesses. The time set out the world's first war correspondent, William Howard Russell, in 1854. His reports from the battle lines had a powerful effect on the British public. A war fund was organized to help the soldiers. Russell forced the government to accept the offer of Florence Nightingale to organize nurses to travel to Crimea. A photographer, Roger Fenton, sent back photos from the war, which were published in the times. Meanwhile, in America, a more popular approach to newspapers had developed. The newspaper had spread west with the pioneers, and nearly every little settlement had its own paper. American newspapers were cheaper and livelier than British ones. They were aimed at the average person, rather than the governing class. Examples of the new style of editing and publishing were Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hurst. Hurst especially employed sensational and emotional writing, which aimed at stirring up the public to action. Hurst is sometimes accused of starting the Spanish-American War of 1898 with his overheated editorials. Nonetheless, his methods were successful in raising circulation, and were widely imitated. The modern newspaper contains more than hard news. In fact, news may be a fairly small part of it. Advertisements, gossip, show business, photos of celebrities, sports, stock market prices, horoscopes, comic strips, weather reports, and much more are found in its pages. The modern newspaper is a total entertainment package. A question for the future is whether electronic newspapers will replace paper newspapers.",238.34125,136.19128035956848,Ideal

Some radio stations provide news and information. Other radio stations have a talk format, where listeners can call the radio stations experts to discuss political affairs or to ask for personal advice.

There are some stations that play only classical music. Other radio stations mainly play jazz music. Some very popular radio stations play hard rock music. Others specialize in country music. Some people prefer radio stations that play rhythm and blues music. Still, other people enjoy radio stations that specialize in soft, easy listening music.

short-stories-0238-240-the-grand-canyon.wav,"The Grand Canyon The Grand Canyon is one of the most spectacular sights in nature, is found in one section of the Valley of the Colorado River. The river begins its course high in the Rocky Mountains of the state of Colorado. River travels a total of 1400 miles through Colorado, Utah, and Arizona, and into the Gulf of California. It forms part of Arizona's border with Nevada and California. The Colorado River is a very swift and muddy river. It carries dirt and rocks down from the mountains. The story is told of an old fur trader who was attacked by Indians high up the river. His only escape was down the Colorado River in a small boat. It was a terrifying trip through rapids and around rocks at top speed. The fur trader was found some days later in very rough shape hundreds of miles down the river. No one would believe that he had come so far so fast. The Grand Canyon stretches for about 250 miles in the state of Arizona. The canyon was carved out by the flow of the river itself. In places, the canyon is more than a mile deep. It stretches from 4 to 18 miles wide at the top. The canyon valley contains worn rocks that rise up like a mountain range. The canyon has been worn down through many layers of rock. The river has cut its way down through layers of sandstone, limestone and shaped to the granite bedrock. The different layers are of different colors and the rocks appear very beautiful, especially at sunrise and sunset. Because the canyon is so deep, the climate changes as you go down into the valley. At the top, the climate is typical of a mountain area with evergreen trees. Next, you have typical forest trees. Third, there are plants like cacti that grow in warm deserts. Finally, there are subtropical plants at the valley bottom. Tourists can ride down the narrow trails to the bottom of the valley on mules. On one side is the rock wall of the canyon and on the other side is a steep drop down to the bottom. Tourists have to trust their guide and the mule that they are riding to get them down safely. The trails zigzag back and forth and the tourist going down travels much more than a mile. Some 1,000 square miles of the area became the Grand Canyon National Park in 1919. Because the Colorado River is very swift and runs through dry country, several dams have been built along it. These are designed to harness its power, save its water and provide recreational opportunities. The best known dam is Hoover Dam, formerly Boulder Dam, on the Arizona Nevada border. This impressive structure is 727 feet high and 1282 feet long. Elevators are used to carry workers up and down inside the dam, the water which is backed up by the Hoover Dam forms Lake Mead. Lake Mead is used to irrigate nearby land as well as for boating and fishing. The dam itself is a major source of electric power for this section of the country. Visitors to the Grand Canyon are often filled with awe by the size and beauty of the canyon. People seem very small in comparison to the immense cliffs, valleys and the mighty river.",198.530625,169.24341017916004,Fast

ielts-listening-0306-ielts-recent-actual-test-29-part-2.wav,"Good morning everyone and welcome to the second annual Wallabaloo conference on mastering computer languages. I hope you all had a good trip. Before we get underway with today's program, let me fill you in as to what's on tap for tomorrow, Sunday, February 19th. At 9am, right here in the main hall, we'll be hearing a lecture from Dr. John Smith about computerist teacher. Professor Smith from the University of Melbourne is a world-class expert in the field of computer assisted education, and his talk promises to be both stimulating and informative. Immediately afterwards at 10.30, there will be a presentation of papers by various delegates. That, however, will take place in the garden room on the ground floor. If you don't yet know, the garden room is also called the ballroom, and will be gathering at the west end, the slightly raised area called level 2. Just look for the crowd. If you get lost, there are signs in the foyer. After all that thinking, talking and listening, I expect everyone will be a bit weary. So in 1115, there will be a break for coffee, cookies and other light refreshments. These will be available at the aptly named refreshment stand, placed by the door back here in the main hall. Also, if you choose to skip the formal lunch, you can buy a packed lunch at the stand for a reasonable price. I strongly urge you, however, to join us at the formal lunch. That won't be till 1 o'clock sharp, so you have time to stroll about town a bit. We'll be eating at the Sea View restaurant. The restaurant is located right here in the hotel on the top floor. It's a good dozen flights of stairs, so I suggest you take the lift on the ground foray. If you're not fond of fish, there's an all-you-can-eat barbecue available as well. They even offer wallaby meat. After lunch, we'll treat back downstairs to level 2 in the ballroom for the presentation of further papers, which will begin at 2pm. Please try to be on time. I know you'll be a bit tired after lunch, but the ballroom echoes so with people coming in late. Thank you in advance. Once we've heard the papers, we'll break for afternoon tea at 3pm. No need to walk. The manager of the refreshments stand has graciously agreed to have tea served in the ballroom. He's even promised us some special scones, baked from a recipe of his dear old Scottish grandmother. Then, tea being drunk and scones munched, we'll retire here to the main hall for some closing remarks and questions. So, by 5 o'clock, we should have the conference wrapped up. But the fun is in over. This is Australia mates. We'll be flocking to the hotel's own palm lounge on the east side of the foyer for an informal reception. You can relax, mingle with the other delegates and let your hair down a bit. This will run from 510 to 610, though you're free to stay as long as you like. The lounge manager has informed me that for the duration of the actual reception, you can have or you can drink beer for $20 with purchase of an advanced ticket. And yes, tickets can be purchased from any conference organizer or at the front desk anytime between now and the start of the reception. I suggest you come by tomorrow evening to pick up the tickets, since the conference hall only holds 800 people. That way you can also get your journey plan ahead of time and be sure not to miss this truly memorable conference. If you want cocktails, however, I'm sorry, you'll have to pay for those at the regular price. Oh my goodness, speaking of paying, I see I forgot to tell you a couple of things. The first is about lunch. The charge for the lunch will be $15 for all you delegates. If you have guests with you, the cost is $25 for the general public and $6.50 for children under the age of 10. That's $15 each, not total for everyone. Another item is about the lunch menu. I very much urge you to try the fish. I mean, look at the restaurant's name, the Sea View. As the name suggests, it is a famous seafood restaurant. The chef is a bask from Spain, and he really gets quite put out when people ignore his fish specialities for burgers or barbecue. If fish isn't your thing though, try the steak. He makes an exquisite filet minion, talked with blue cheese and mushrooms. Finally, if you'd like to buy a ticket, you can have both a lunch and unlimited beer for $35. I should have mentioned that earlier, but I am a bit forgetful. Maybe I should avoid the beer after the conference, eh? Well, I've said my bit. Are there any questions?",299.938,164.63402436503546,Fast

So let's see first what is digitalization. Digitalization is the process of using digital technologies to change how we live, work and interact with each other. So let's see how this affects human life in villages. Digitalization has brought many positive changes to village life by connecting rural communities to the bite of a world. With access to smartphones, internet and digital tools, people in villages can now access online education, healthcare services, government support and marketing information as well. Human skin now check whether objects, crop prices and even sell their products online. Digital banking and mobile payments have made financial services more accessible, reducing the need to travel long distances. Overall, digitalization helps improve communication, create job opportunities and raise the standard of living in rural areas, making life easier, smarter and more connected.

ielts-listening-0196-cam7-test-1-part-4.wav,"Good afternoon everyone. This is the first seminar in preparation for our archaeological field work in Namibia. We are fantastically lucky to have received partial research funding for this trip from our institute, so I shall expect 200% attention and participation from you all. First in this seminar I'm going to give a brief introduction to contemporary research on rock art and in the second part I'm going to give you some do's and don'ts for our fieldwork trip in April, so please listen very carefully. I'm first going to focus on the interpretation of rock art in Namibia. We're very fortunate to be going to an area where you can find some of the most important sites in the entire world and I hope to show you how easy it is for everyone to make mistakes in looking at cultures which are different from our own. The first and most important lesson we have to learn. In Namibia there are both paintings and engravings. That's where the surface of the rock is cut out. Many of the engravings show footprints of animals and most scholars used to think that the purpose of these was simple and obvious. This rock art was like a school book with pictures to teach children about tracks which track belong to which animal, giraffe, lion and so on. But there were some mysteries. First when you look at a typical Namibian painting or engraving you see the tracks are repeated. There are dozens of tracks for the same animal. You'd expect just one clear illustration if the reason the aim was to teach tracking. Now there were two more problems. Why are some of the engravings of animals very accurate as you'd expect, or clearly identifiable, and others quite unrealistic? And another mystery. Some of these unrealistic animals that's in the engravings seem to be half human. Some for example have got human faces. Many researchers now think that these were pictures the wise men engraved of themselves. They believe they could use magic to control the animals they had drawn so the hunters could then catch them for food. This shows you some of the dangers of coming from one culture to another, as we'll be doing, without understanding it fully. Scholars imagine that children looked at rock art pictures to learn to track, just because they themselves had learnt skills from pictures. Many researchers now believe that rock art had a much more complex purpose, and we'll talk more about it next week. Now, before I invite you to join in a discussion in this second part of the seminar, I'd like to make some very important points about our fieldwork, and in fact, any field trip to look at rock art. We're going to a number of sites, and we won't always be together. The single largest problem faced by people who manage the sites is, yes, I'm sure you guessed, damaged caused by visitors, even though it's usually unintentional. Whenever you do go to a site, don't forget you can learn many things from observing at a distance instead of walking all over it. This can really help to reduce visitor pressure. People often say, well, there's only two of us, and just this one time, but maybe thousands of people are saying the same thing. And then some basic rules to guide you. We'll have our own camp near a village, but remember never to camp on a site if you go on your own. It may be disrespectful to the people of that culture, and certainly don't make fires, however romantic it may seem. It's really dangerous in dry areas, and you can easily burn priceless undiscovered material by doing so. So, how are we going to enjoy the rock art on our field trip? By looking at it, drawing it, and photographing it. Never by touching it or even tracing it. Rock art is fragile and precious. Remember that climbing on rocks and in caves can destroy in a moment what has lasted for centuries. So, no heroics in Namibia, please. Try to be extra careful and help others to be too. Oh, and lastly, please don't even move rocks or branches to take photographs. You should leave the site intact. I'm sure I can rely on you to do that. Well, that's about all I want to say before today's first discussion, but if you have any questions, please ask them now. Oh, and don't forget you'll find some fascinating information about worldwide sites on the internet. Right, first question then.",287.256125,159.78771557960687,Fast
short-stories-0178-179-alcohol.wav,"Alcohol Alcohol is the oldest drug that is used in western countries. For thousands of years, people have made alcoholic beverages. These beverages are made by allowing a process called fermentation to occur. Alcoholic fermentation happens when yeasts or bacteria break down the sugars that occur in some liquids and convert some sugars into alcohol. Many liquids such as fruit juices can ferment. In the past few years, alcoholic drinks were common in the Middle East. However, the Islamic religion forbids alcohol, so very little alcohol is consumed in this part of the world. In European countries and in other parts of the world, many different kinds of alcoholic beverages are produced and consumed. In warmer areas of Europe, people make wine by allowing grape juice to ferment. In cooler areas of Europe, people make beer by fermenting liquids made from water and various grains. The process of fermentation is also used to make stronger drinks known as spirits. These drinks include vodka, whiskey and rum. The techniques for making good wine, beer and spirits have been developed over hundreds of years and require scientific precision. Some people have developed a great appreciation for well-made wine, beer or spirits and have become experts about the many different varieties of these beverages. Many people appreciate the taste of alcoholic beverages, but many also enjoy the feelings that alcohol causes. Alcohol belongs to a category of drugs called depressants because it depresses the central nervous system, causing a person to feel less inhibited or restrained. Many people enjoy this feeling, but when a person drinks a lot of alcohol, he or she loses coordination, balance and judgment. Speech may become unclear, and the person may speak too much. Some people become aggressive or depressed. When a person is under the influence of alcohol, the person is set to be drunk. One of the problems that can result from alcohol consumption is known as drunk driving. Some people try to drive a car after having consumed alcohol, but this is extremely dangerous. Each year, thousands of people are killed by drunk drivers who lose control of their cars. In recent years, attempts have been made to reduce this problem by public education campaigns and by strict laws and punishments. If you drink, don't drive. Another problem associated with alcohol is addiction, and it's known as alcoholism. Some people drink so frequently that they develop a psychological addiction to alcohol. This problem can have terrible consequences for a person's health, personal relationships and career. Alcoholic beverages are firmly a part of Western culture and of many other cultures also. On one hand, drinks provide many people with much enjoyment and appreciation. On the other hand, alcohol is a drug that can be abused, leading to accidents and addiction.",182.02125,152.9491748902944,Fast

The city of New York has a population of over 7 million people, and the surrounding urban areas bring the total to about 20 million people. However, New York City is not merely a very large city. It is also known as one of the world's leading centers of financial, artistic, and media activities. Compared with most of the great cities of the world, New York is very young. The first permanent settlements were established during the 17th century by settlers from the Netherlands. Those people named their town, New Amsterdam. Soon, the colony was taken over by English settlers who renamed the city New York. New York grew quickly, and by the 19th century, it was the largest city of the United States. New York was usually the place where new immigrants to the United States would arrive. In the 19th century, immigrants from Germany and Ireland were numerous in New York. In the early 20th century, New York City was the home of many Jewish immigrants, and also immigrants from Italy. In addition, many African-American people arrived in New York from other parts of the United States, and many persons came to New York from the American territory of Puerto Rico, a Spanish-speaking island in the Caribbean. In more recent decades, immigrants have arrived in New York from places all over the world. One of the most famous features of New York City is its dramatic skyline. New York has more tall buildings, called skyscrapers, than any other city in the world. Many of the tallest and most interesting buildings in New York, including the Woolworth Building, the Chrysler Building, and the Empire State Building, were constructed during the early decades of the 20th century. In addition to these impressive buildings, New York is also known for the huge bridges that join the island of Manhattan to the surrounding areas. The Brooklyn Bridge is the most famous of these remarkable and old bridges. Of course, New York is famous for much more than just its architecture. New York City's financial district, Wall Street, and its theater district, centered on Broadway, are the most important in the United States. Central Park is one of the world's great urban parks, and the art galleries, museums, and concert halls are among the greatest to be found anywhere. The United Nations has its headquarters in New York City. People around the world recognize the famous Statue of Liberty, which stands on an island in the harbor of New York, and the bustling Times Square, located in the Midtown, Manhattan area. Visitors to New York find it to be an extremely busy, fast-placed city, and are struck by the extremes of wealth and poverty that surround it.

Because even though we speak on meetings or text through WhatsApp, this is the first time that I got to meet most of them. Well, I have met Mihaara, Khasun and Rashmi Kabiko, but this was the first time meeting the rest. And it was a really nice experience. And throughout the whole summit, we worked as a team and we had each other's back throughout the whole day. And when talking about the summit, it was actually in my words, it's amazing. And I'm pretty sure everyone else would agree on that. And these kind of events, these are actually really good for networking. Because we get to know individuals and companies who are into AI and how they are working towards making a success in the AI field. And having speakers from our neighbor in the neighboring country, India was also actually plasma and mostly, we start our work session. So in that session, there was a video that he shared with us. And that really caught my eye. This video was regarding GPT. How it can be your eyes? Like even if you can't see the world, you apply. But then you can ask AI to describe your surrounding and it will describe it to you. So through AI, we get to see what kind of environment we are in. So that's the place where AI is right now. And like others mentioned, we got, we are like obtained a lot from this summit. And I'm honestly really grateful and glad that I got this opportunity. And I'm really happy that I went, I got this experience with our wonderful team. And next slide. So talking about the input that we can give to our company from the knowledge that we get. Next slide. So I would like to mention that since we are starting the AI start up this month, we should have the knowledge, we should this knowledge be gained. It can, we can really use it well. For example, LLMS and SLMS, we can see where we should use work. And we should identify which suits better in which scenarios. And when it comes to deep learning, we got to know about neural network architectures, such as CNNs and that it is best for training models. So we should know to go ahead with the latest algorithms and use hybrid methods because that would be more efficient. And with learning and implementing these, we can open more doors to innovative solutions, inhale care, retail and so on. Learning about real-world applications throughout the summit and across the different industries, it was actually very inspiring. And something Minister Kanaka Herat said was that there are some ongoing products, ongoing, sorry, ongoing events and, projects in Sri Lanka related to AI and one was in health care. And yeah, honestly, we should look forward to that. And it's really great to see that Sri Lanka is at a place like that in AI. And I think it would be really good for us as we're going forward.

It was founded in 1885 after the discovery of the cave and basin hot springs. From humble beginnings as a 26 square kilometer hot springs reserve, Banth National Park now consists of 6,641 square kilometers of unparalleled mountain scenery nestled in the heart of the magnificent Canadian Rockies. Each year millions of visitors come to Banth to marvel at the emerald waters of Lake Louise, walk amongst the flower-filled heavens at sunshine meadows, and drive beneath the towering jagged peaks, lining the ice fields parkway between Banth and Jasper. 10,000 years ago, natives camped on the shores of the Vermillion Lakes beneath the wind-swept peak of Mount Rundle. They were the only people here to enjoy the mountain landscape, the beautiful sunrises and the hot springs. Nearly 10 millennia later, a struggling nation forged a crazy dream of connecting itself from sea to sea with steel rails, and from this railway venture was born Canada's most famous park, Banth National Park. Banth National Park contains some of the most spectacular mountain scenery in the world. Snow-capped peaks, glistening glaciers, ice fields, alpine meadows, blue-cold crystal-clear lakes, raging rivers, mineral hot springs, deep canyons, hudus, and sweeping vistas are just one part of the allure of Banth National Park. The park is also the home of some of North America's wildest creatures, including black and grizzly bears, caribou, and wolves. Banth and Lake Louise are two major towns in Banth National Park. As the largest town in the park, Banth is Canada's highest town, at 1,384 meters, 4,540 feet above sea level. Lake Louise, with its blue-green water set against the stark backdrop of Victoria Glacier, is the highest permanent settlement in Canada, at 1,536 meters, 5,039 feet above the sea level, and probably the most beloved and most photographed scene in the Canadian Rockies.

short-stories-0190-191-scotland.wav,"Scotland. Scotland is the country that is located on the northern part of the island of Great Britain. The Scottish people are one of the four main nationalities of the British Isles together with the English, the Welsh and the Irish. Scotland and its people have played an important part in the history of the English-speaking world. Scotland can be roughly divided into two main regions. The lowland areas in the southern part of Scotland contain most of the population and the two main cities Edinburgh and Glasgow. Most of Scotland's agriculture and industry are located in the lowland areas. The highland areas, together with the islands that lie off the coast of Scotland, are not so heavily populated. The lakes and mountains of the highlands are known for their beautiful scenery. One of the main themes of Scottish history is conflict with England. During the Middle Ages, the English and Scottish kings were often at war. Around the year 1300, the Scots repelled some invasions from England. During the 1600s, though, Scotland and England had the same king and the countries were officially joined as the United Kingdom in 1701. For people in the Highlands of Scotland, the 18th century was very difficult. Most people worked as farmers on land that was owned by a few wealthy landlords. The landlords decided that they could make more money on the land if they evicted the farmers so many of the farmers were forced to leave. The Highlanders rebelled against the king in 1745, but they were defeated. During the 18th and 19th centuries, many people left the Highlands of Scotland. They moved to the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. During the 19th century, Scotland was the first country to have universal public education for children. The country produced a great number of famous scientists and inventors during that time. Scotland is famous for its national costume. This costume includes the kilt, which is an elanth skirt worn by both men and women. The kilt is made from a fabric that contains stripes of different colors and widths, which cross over each other to produce a pattern that is called a tartan. In the Scottish Highlands groups of related families called clans have their own unique tartan. Another famous part of Scottish heritage is the musical instrument known as the bagpipes. The bagpipes have a distinctive sound that is easily recognized. Bagpipes were originally played to intimidate enemies in battle, but today Scottish people play the bagpipes at parades and other celebrations. People of Scottish heritage around the world celebrate their heritage on January 25th of each year. This day celebrates the birthday of Robbie Burns, the famous Scottish poet. People celebrate this day at parades where people eat a famous Scottish food called haggis. Today, Scotland remains part of the United Kingdom, but some Scottish people would like Scotland to become independent. Whatever the Scottish people decide, their country will remain a unique and interesting place.",180.819625,165.24754987186816,Fast

short-stories-0272-275-stephen-foster---american-songwriter.wav,"Stephen Foster, American songwriter. Before radio and television, movies and recordings entered Tameh was often a family or community matter. Someone in the family could play a musical instrument or a neighborhood musician would play for small gatherings. In addition, there would be traveling groups of musicians, actors, and clowns who would go from town to town. In 19th century United States, one of the most popular forms of entertainment was the minstrel show. Black slavery was still permitted in the southern states until 1865. Even after that date, the lives of many blacks working on large farms or plantations did not change much. They did hard physical labor in the fields, had little control over their lives, and very little time to relax with their friends. Foster, who was born in 1826, made this situation the background for many of his songs. White musicians would try to imagine the feelings of black men and women working on the plantations. They would write songs in the dialect or speech patterns that they thought black slaves used. In these songs, the black people would be talking about their hardships, falling in love, playing music, and dancing, and finally growing old and dying. White performers would blacken their faces and sing these songs to white audiences. They would play musical instruments like the banjo, a small four-string guitar, which black people played often. As a small boy, Stephen Foster had sometimes been taken to a black church by his family's black servant, Olivia Pies. Here he first heard the melodies that inspired his own songs. Only a couple of Foster's songs are based directly on Negro's spirituals, but many of his songs have the natural simplicity and emotional power of folk songs. The youngest member of a large family, Foster showed his musical talent at an early age. He played the flute, violin, and piano. Growing up in an energetic business family, Stephen was expected to become a businessman. And for a while he worked as a bookkeeper. All his spare time, however, was spent writing songs. Foster attended minstrel shows and tried to get the performers to sing his songs. Sometimes the performers would steal his songs and publish them under their own names. Copyright laws were weak and rarely enforced, so some music publishers would just go ahead and publish a song without paying the songwriter. Since Foster hoped to make a living as a songwriter, this was a problem. Foster's first hit song was O'Susana, published in 1848. It became popular with thousands of men from all over the United States who were heading west to the California Gold Rush of 1849. Unfortunately, as an unknown songwriter, Foster received no money from his early songs. He seems to have given them outright to the music publishers just to establish his reputation. Foster's name, however, was soon widely known. And in 1849 he was able to afford to give up bookkeeping and marry the daughter of a Pittsburgh physician. During the next five years he earned a moderately good income from songwriting. In 1851 a daughter Marion was born. Foster wrote many of his best-known songs at this time. Old folks at home in 1851, my old Kentucky home in 1853, and Jeannie with a light brown hair in 1854. Difficulties and Foster's marriage began fairly soon. These may have been partly due to his strange work habits. He spent days locked in his room working on his songs. Then he would rush out with his materials to the local music store, presumably to test out the songs on his friends. He also became more and more addicted to alcohol. Eventually his wife and daughter left him. Foster died alone in a rooming house in 1864. Immigrants to the United States sprung their traditional folk songs with them, and wherever there are very few typically American songs, Foster provided many songs that expressed the life of 19th century USA. His songs were easy to sing and were popular with nearly everyone. In a sense, Foster helped to create roots for American popular music.",235.0759375,174.3266471073842,Fast

ielts-listening-0104-cam13-test-2-part-4.wav,"Today we'll be continuing the series of lectures on memory by focusing on what is called episodic memory and what can happen if this is not working properly. Episodic memory refers to the memory of an event or episode. Episodic memories allow us to mentally travel back in time to an event from the past. Episodic memories include various details about these events. For example, when an event happened and other information such as the location. To help understand this concept, try to remember the last time you ate dinner at a restaurant. The ability to remember where you ate, who you were with and the items you ordered are all features of an episodic memory. Episodic memory is distinct from another type of memory called semantic memory. This is the type of factual memory that we have in common with everyone else. That is your general knowledge of the world. To build upon a previous example, remembering where you parked your car is an example of episodic memory. But your understanding of what a car is and how an engine works are examples of semantic memory. Unlike episodic memory, semantic memory isn't dependent on recalling personal experiences. Episodic memory can be thought of as a process with several different steps of memory processing, encoding, consolidation and retrieval. The initial step is called encoding. This involves the process of receiving and registering information, which is necessary for creating memories of information or events that you experience. The degree to which you can successfully encode information depends on the level of attention you give to an event while it's actually happening. Being distracted can make effective encoding very difficult. Encoding of episodic memories is also influenced by how you process the event. For example, if you were introduced to someone called Charlie, you might make the connection that your uncle has the same name. Future recollection of Charlie's name is much easier if you have a strategy to help you encode it. Memory consolidation, the next step in forming an episodic memory, is the process by which memories of encoded information are strengthened, stabilized and stored to facilitate later retrieval. Consolidation is most effective when the information being stored can be linked to an existing network of information. Consolidation makes it possible for you to store memories for later retrieval indefinitely. Forming strong memories depends on the frequency with which you try to retrieve them. Memories can fade or become harder to retrieve if they aren't used very often. The last step in forming episodic memories is called retrieval, which is the conscious recollection of encoded information. Retrieving information from episodic memory depends upon semantic, all-factory, auditory and visual factors. These help episodic memory retrieval by acting as a prompt. For example, when recalling where you parked your car, you may use the colour of a sign close to where you parked. You actually have to mentally travel back to the moment you parked. There are a wide range of neurological diseases and conditions that can affect episodic memory. These range from Alzheimer's to schizophrenia to autism. An impairment of episodic memory can have a profound effect on individuals' lives. For example, the symptoms of schizophrenia can be reasonably well controlled by medication. However, patients' episodic memory may still be impaired and so they are often unable to return to university or work. Recent studies have shown that computer assisted games designed to keep the brain active can help improve their episodic memory. Episodic memories can help people connect with others, for instance by sharing intimate details about their past. Something individuals with autism often have problems with. This may be caused by an absence of a sense of self. This is essential for the storage of episodic memory and has been found to be impaired in children with autism. Research has shown that treatments that improve memory may also have a positive impact on children's social development. One study looked at a...",416.897375,95.27524609623651,Slow

short-stories-0279-283-the-planetarium.wav,"The Planetarium All around the world, star gazing is a popular activity. The night sky lit up with stars is one of the most impressive scenes in nature. Besides its natural beauty, people study the night sky for many reasons. Some believe that they can read the future in the stars. Others think that the stars influence the weather while some people worship the stars and the planets. There is a problem with star gazing. If the night is cloudy, people on the ground cannot see the stars. It's also bad weather makes being outside at night uncomfortable. Besides, not everybody wants to stay up late at night. A Planetarium is an ideal solution to all these problems. A Planetarium is usually a large dome covered building. It has seating like a theater. The program here is a star show. A special projector throws a picture of the night sky on the ceiling of the Planetarium Theater. Like a movie projector, the Planetarium projector can show a constantly changing program. It can show how the stars look right now, how they looked thousands of years ago, and how they will look in the future. Planetariums can be both entertaining and educational. Schoolchildren can go to learn about the nine planets of the solar system, or about the various groupings of stars. Planetarians can teach you how to find the stars and planets yourself when you're out at night. There can also be dramatic showings about changes to the universe over time. This is also a way to view special phenomena like Haley's comet, which only appears once in a lifetime. Planetarians can also show how ancient people view the skies. Shepherds living out under the sky imagine that groups of stars represented wonderful people and huge animals. Stories were told about these constellations. Sometimes the story explained how the people or animals became stars. For example, why Orion, the mighty hunter, is chasing tourists the bull. Planetarians can project these figures on their screen. They can also speed up changes in the heavens. It takes about 28 days for the moon to travel through all its faces. Changes in the moon or in the sun can be shown easily. Planetarians can also show the sky the way it appears in another part of the world, or the way it appeared on a famous historical occasion. Special heavenly phenomena such as a meteor shower can also be demonstrated. Things that appear only rarely in the real sky can be shown every night. A planetarian is usually concerned to put into special programs to keep its audience coming back.

ielts-listening-0150-cam10-test-2-part-2.wav,"Good morning. I'm very pleased to have this opportunity to say a little about two exciting new developments in the city, the Brackenside Open Air Swimming Pool and the Children's Adventure playground in Central Park. As many of you may know, the idea for these initiatives came from you, the public, in extensive consultation exercise which the City Council conducted last year. And they have been realised using money from the SWRDC, the South West Regional Development Commission. First of all, Brackenside Pool. As many of the older members of the audience will remember, there used to be a wonderful open air pool on the C-front 30 years ago, but it had to close when it was judged to be unsafe. For the design of this new heated pool, we were very happy to secure the talents of internationally renowned architect, Ellen Wendon, who was managed to combine a charming 1930s design which fits in so well with many of the other buildings in the area, with up to the minute features such as a recycling system, the only one of its kind in the world, which enables seawater to be used in the pool. Now, there's been quite a bit of discussion in the local press about whether there would be enough room for the number of visitors we're hoping to attract, but the design is deceptive, and there have been rigorous checks about capacity. Also, just in case you are wondering, we're on schedule for June 15th opening date, and well within budget, a testimony to the excellent work of local contractors, Hickman's. We hope that as many people as possible will be there on June 15th. We have engaged award-winning actress Coral White to declare the pool open, and there'll be drinks and snacks available at the pool side. There'll also be a competition for the public to decide on the sculpture we plan to have at the entrance. You will decide which famous historical figure from the city we should have. And now, moving on to the central park playground, which we're pleased to announce has just won the Douglas Award for Safety. The news came through only last week. The unique design is based on the concept of the global village, with a playground being divided into six areas showing different parts of the world, each with a representative feature. For example, there is a section on Asia, and this is represented by rides and equipment in the shape of snakes, orangutans, tigers, and so on, forna native to the forests of the region. Moving south to the Antarctic, we couldn't run to an ice rink, I'm afraid, but opted instead for climbing blocks in the shape of mountains. I thought they could have had slides for the glaciers, but the designers did want to avoid being too literal. Then onto South America, and here the theme is El Dorado, games replicating the search for mines full of precious stones. And then, moving up to North America, here there was considerable debate. I know the contribution of cinema and jazz was considered, but the designers finally opted for rockets and the International Space Station. Eastwoods to Europe then, and perhaps the most traditional choice of all the areas, medieval castles, and other fortifications. Then last, but not least, moving south to Africa, at a whole set of wonderful mosaics and trails to represent the great rivers of this fascinating and varied continent. Now, the opening date for our global playground is the 10th of July, and again, we'd love to see you there. So, make a date and come and see this magnificent, original new amenity right in the heart of the city.",225.3055625,164.57649597532682,Fast
short-stories-0255-258-north-american-death-and-burial.wav,"North American Deaf and Barrel Most people in North America die either in hospital or at home. When someone dies, arrangements are made with a funeral home to get the body and prepare it for burial. Funeral homes are private businesses. They usually handle most or all aspects of a funeral, except for providing the burial plot. That usually has to be purchased separately. Funeral homes may operate in many kinds of buildings, old, roomy, private homes, and new modern one-level buildings are common types. When the funeral director receives the body, his staff embombs it so it will not decay quickly and will look lifelike at the funeral service. For one or two days before the burial, friends, relatives, and acquaintances are invited to visit the funeral home and pay their respects to the dead person. The deceased person is usually dressed in their best clothes and lying on their back in a coffin. A coffin is a large wooden or metal chest designed to hold the body. Members of the dead person's immediate family usually act as hosts for the funeral home visitation. They greet the mourners and talk to them about the deceased. Usually, there are happy photographs of the dead person near the coffin. Gifts of flowers also surround the coffin. Usually, the mourners are asked to sign a guest book. The funeral service may take place at a church if the deceased person wanted that. Frequently, however, the service is held at a chapel at the funeral home. Attending a funeral is considered a sign of respect and people will often travel a long distance to attend. Usually, friends and relatives will take a day off work for the occasion. Notices are put in the newspaper for several days before so that people will know when to come. A minister or priest usually conducts the funeral service. There will be hymns, prayers, and perhaps a sermon like a regular church service. Sometimes, the minister will speak at length about the dead person. Sometimes, a member of the family does this. Opportunity is allowed for other people to talk about their memories of the dead person. At the end of the service, the coffin is wheeled out to a waiting car called a hers, which drives the dead person to the burial place. The mourners go to their cars and follow the hers to the cemetery. At the cemetery, a hole has already been dug to receive the coffin. Usually, there is a short ceremony at the grave. Sometimes, flowers are put on top of the coffin as it is lowered into the grave. A handful of soil is tossed on the coffin, indicating burial. Usually, the mourners leave before the cemetery workers cover the coffin with earth. Then the mourners may go back to a church hall or restaurant for a meal. A funeral can be quite costly. Even an inexpensive coffin can be several thousand dollars. Sometimes, the deceased will be placed in an expensive rental coffin for the visitation and funeral, but buried in a less expensive coffin. Even so, a full funeral rarely costs less than five thousand dollars, and is usually quite a lot more. This does not include the price of the burial plot or the stone grave marker. Sometimes poor people are buried at government expense. It is traditional in North America to bury the whole body in the ground. However, cremation is becoming more popular. The advantage of cremation is that it is less expensive, uses less land, and it appeals to people who don't want an elaborate funeral. Some people may wonder why so much attention is paid to a dead person, but funerals are really for the living. They are a way of saying goodbye to the dead person and receiving mutual support and encouragement from friends and family. Some funeral homes help to organize grief counseling or support groups to grieving family members. Usually, the funeral service is performed in the Christian tradition and refers to the hope of resurrection or rebirth from the dead that Christians believe in. It is now becoming common for people to plan their own funeral service before they die, and usually attempts are made to make the service appropriate to the person who died. This makes it more satisfying and memorable for family and friends.",259.5265625,167.8440911033914,Fast

short-stories-0167-168-two-great-artists-leonardo-and-michelangelo.wav,"Two great artists, Leonardo and Michelangelo. Many people admire the paintings in sculptures that artists create. Some very beautiful paintings and sculptures were created by two men who lived in the same country at the same time. These men were Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo. They both lived in Italy around the year 1500. Leonardo da Vinci is most famous for his painting called the Mona Lisa. This is perhaps the best-known painting in the world. The Mona Lisa shows the head and shoulders of a dark haired woman. When people look at this painting, they are often captivated by her smile and by her eyes, which have a look of mystery. Another painting of Leonardo's is called the Last Supper. This painting shows a famous scene from the Christian religion. In this painting, Jesus Christ is seated at the middle of a long table with his followers, the disciples, seated around him. Many of the paintings that were created at this time have a religious theme. Leonardo was not only an artist, he was also interested in engineering. He actually worked for some time as an advisor to a military leader, helping him to develop new machines for use in war. Leonardo also made rough drawings of machines that are similar to those that were invented much later, such as submarines and helicopters. Obviously, Leonardo was an extremely creative man. Michelangelo was about 23 years younger than Leonardo. In addition to being a painter, Michelangelo was also a sculptor, and many experts consider him the greatest sculptor of all time. One of his most famous sculptures is David, which is a statue of a young man who was a famous figure in the Bible. Another great sculpture of Michelangelo is called the Pida. The Pida shows Mary, mother of Jesus, holding the baby of her son across her lap. Michelangelo is also famous for painting, the ceiling of a church known as a Sistine Chapel. The leader of the Roman Catholic Church, Pope Julius, asked Michelangelo to paint the ceiling of this new church. This project required many years of hard work, and the Pope complained that it took too long. However, when the work was finished, the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel was covered with beautiful paintings of many scenes from the Bible. Fortunately, many of the works of Leonardo and of Michelangelo can still be seen today in our galleries of Europe. During the past 500 years, the color of the paintings had faded somewhat, but in recent years, some work has been done to restore the paintings to their original appearance.",197.4335,132.19641043693193,Ideal

Halloween is not an official holiday, everyone goes to work or to school on Halloween just as on any other day. But Halloween is still one of the holidays that children like the most. Why do children like Halloween so much? There are two reasons, costumes and candy. On the evening of October 31st, children dress up in strange and unusual costumes. They wear costumes that may look like a witch, a monster, or many other weird things. Putting on these scary costumes is a lot of fun for children. After the children put on their costumes, they walk from house to house during the evening. The children carry large bags with them. At each house, they stop and knock at the door. When an adult opens the door, the children shout, trick or treat. The adult who opens the door pretends to be frightened and then puts pieces of candy into each child's open bag. At the end of the evening, the children have visited many houses and have collected much candy. During the next several days, they can feast upon the sweet candies that they have received. Another Halloween tradition is very unusual. In each house, a family gets a very large round orange vegetable called a pumpkin. They cut a hole in the top of the pumpkin and empty out the flesh and seeds of the vegetable. Then they cut holes in the side of the pumpkin so that it appears to have eyes, a nose, and a mouth. When the carving is finished, the pumpkin looks almost like a person's face. When the pumpkin has been carved to look like a face, people place a light inside the pumpkin so that the vegetable seems to glow in the dark. This strange looking face is called a jack-o-lantern. On Halloween evening, one can see many of these jack-o-lanterns, some of which are very beautifully carved.

For example, the students of the art college have produced a number of videos, all connected with relationships between children and their grandparents. That sounds interesting.

She could only learn by feeling with her hands. This was very frustrating for Helen, her mother, and her father. Helen Keller grew up in Alabama, USA, during the 1880s and 1890s. At that time, people who had lost the use of their eyes, ears, and mouth often ended up in charitable institutions. Such a place would provide them with basic food and shelter until they died, or they could go out on the street with a beggar's bowl and ask strangers for money. Since Helen's parents were not poor, she did not have to do either of these things, but her parents knew they would have to do something to help her. One day, when she was six years old, Helen became frustrated that her mother was spending so much time with a new baby. Unable to express her anger, Helen tipped over the baby's crib, nearly injuring the baby. Her parents were horrified and decided to take the last chance open to them. They would try to find someone to teach Helen to communicate. A new school in Boston claimed to be able to teach children like Helen. The Keller's wrote a letter to the school in Boston asking for help. In March of 1887, a teacher, 20-year-old Anne Sullivan arrived at the Keller's home in Tuscumbia, Alabama. Anne Sullivan herself had a very difficult life. Her mother had died when she was eight. Two years later, their father had abandoned Anne and their little brother, Jimmy. Anne was nearly blind and her brother had a diseased hip. No one wanted the two handicapped children, so they were sent to a charitable institution. Jimmy died there. At age 14, Anne, who was not quite blind, was sent to the school for the blind in Boston. Since she had not had any schooling before, she had to start in grade one. Then she had an operation that gave back some of her eyesight. Since Anne knew what it was like to be blind, she was a sympathetic teacher. Before Anne could teach Helen anything, she had to get her attention, because Helen was so hard to communicate with. She was often left alone to do what she pleased. A few days after she arrived, Anne insisted that Helen learn to sit down at the table and eat breakfast properly. Anne told the Keller's to leave and she spent all morning in the breakfast room with Helen. Finally, after a difficult struggle, she got the little girl to sit at the table and use a knife and fork. Since the Keller family did not like to be strict with Helen, Anne decided that she needed to be alone with her for a while. There was a little cottage away from the big house. The teacher and pupil moved there for some weeks. It was here that Anne taught Helen the manual alphabet. This was a system of sign language. But since Helen couldn't see, Anne had to make the signs in her hands so she could feel them. For a long time, Helen had no idea what the words she was learning meant. She learned words like box and cat, but hadn't learned that they referred to those objects. One day, Anne dragged Helen to a water pump and made the signs for water, while she pumped water over Helen's hands. Helen at last made the connection between the signs and the thing. Water was that cool wet liquid stuff. Once Helen realized that the manual alphabet could be used to name things, she ran around naming everything. Before too long, she began to make sentences using the manual alphabet. She also learned to read and write using the square hand alphabet, which was made up of raised square letters. Before long, she was also using Braille and beginning to read books. Helen eventually learned to speak a little, although this was hard for her because she couldn't hear herself. She went on to school and then to Radcliffe College. She wrote articles and books, gave lectures, and worked tirelessly to help the blind. The little girl who couldn't communicate with anyone became in time a wonderful communicator.",254.850625,177.28031861801398,Fast

short-stories-0237-239-the-golden-man-el-dorado.wav,"The Golden Man, El Dorado When Christopher Columbus sailed west from Spain in 1492, he was trying to reach the Spice Islands, which today are called Indonesia. Spices were very scarce and valuable in Europe at this time. No one knew that two vast oceans and the American continents lay between Europe and Asia. Columbus did not find spices in America, but he did bring home some gold trinkets. The American Indians wore these as jewelry. Gold not spices was to become the biggest motive for exploration. Expeditions into the interior of the Americas were very costly and very risky. Only by promising the authorities huge profits could sailors and soldiers raise money for their expeditions. They also needed to promise rich rewards in order to get followers and crews. If a leader returned to Europe without gold and jewels, he might end up in jail. No wonder the Spanish conquerors were always searching for gold. At first the Spaniards stayed around the coasts of the Caribbean Sea, but stories of gold in the interior tempted them to explore inland. They asked the Indians where their gold jewelry came from. The Indians would point further inland. They said that a wealthy people lived in the high mountains that traded gold and emeralds for pearls, cotton and shells. The Spanish Emperor had given the rights to exploit present-day Venezuela and Colombia to his German bankers in 1528. So Germans, Dalfinger, Featherman and Hohermouth led a series of expeditions into the jungle's grasslands and mountains. Meanwhile, Spanish conquerors had found immense riches in gold and silver. Hernando Cortez had captured the kingdom of the Aztecs in Mexico in 1519. He had sent immense treasures to Europe. Soon after this, Francisco Pizarro began to explore the west coast of South America. In 1531 Pizarro invaded Peru and destroyed the kingdom of the Incas. Pizarro melted down the gold and silver treasures of the Incas and sent gold and silver bricks back to Spain. The rush to find more gold became very heated. Rumors came down from the mountains of Colombia about a golden man. El Hombre Dorado. There were stories about a king so rich that he wore gold dust instead of a coat. Russia was the kingdom of the Chippuchas. They were a trading people who traded salt and emeralds for gold, cotton, pearls and shells. The actual gold did not come from their kingdom. It was found in the mountain rivers and brought to the Chippuchas for refining and metalwork. Several armies converged on Chippucha territory. The first to arrive was the Spaniard Cassada, coming up the Magdalena River from the Caribbean. He found the chief cities of the Chippuchas and seized their gold and emeralds. Only afterwards one of Pizarro's captains arrived from Peru and Ecuador. Then the German feathermen arrived from Venezuela. Cassada gave the lakecomers some gold and jewels to ease their disappointment. Cassada's men also found out about the golden man. High in the mountains was a lake created by a meteorite. The Indians believed that the golden god from the sky now lived at the bottom of the lake. When a new leader of the tribe was elected, he was covered in Greece and fine gold dust was blown over his body so that he appeared to be made of gold. He was taken out to the middle of the lake on a raft. He would jump into the lake and stay in the water till the gold dust was washed off. It was considered an offering to the god. Gold ornaments were also tossed in the lake. Then the king and his followers would return to the shore. The ceremony was stopped several generations before the Europeans arrived. Many people were unwilling to believe that this was the whole story. They began to search for a golden city hidden in the jungle. Many explorers perished in this search. In their search for gold, the Spanish conquerors destroyed the great Indian civilizations of America. Towns and villages had been ruined. Thousands of people killed and wonderful pieces of art melted down. Some Indians believe that gold must be a food that Europeans desperately needed to stay alive. In many cases, the Europeans destroyed the trading and social systems that had produced their wealth. When we think about the great achievements of a few conquerors and explorers, we are also sad about how much death and damage they caused.",263.5233125,168.9414100697448,Fast
short-stories-0202-203-north-american-indians.wav,"North American Indians. The first people who lived in North America were the Indians. The name Indians is actually not very accurate because the people are not from India. But when the first Europeans came to North America, they mistakenly believed that they had reached India, so they referred to the people as Indians. In different parts of North America, the Indians had very different cultures and very different ways of making a living. On the west coast of North America, many large rivers flow into the Pacific Ocean. In these rivers is an abundance of fish, such as salmon. The Indians in these areas obtain much of their food by fishing. They lived in settled villages and became experts in carving wood from the tall trees of the area. They carved large canoes for traveling on the rivers and oceans, and they also carved tall totem poles. Totem poles were carvings of various animal or human figures, and often the poles had a mythical or spiritual significance for the people who carved them. Many beautiful totem poles can be seen in cities such as Vancouver or Victoria in the Canadian state of British Columbia or Seattle in the American state of Washington. The Plains Indians lived in the central prairie of North America. The various nations of the plains lived by hunting large animals called buffalo or bison. Horses were brought to North America in the 16th century by the Spanish. The Indians who lived in the prairie areas had learned to become experts at riding horses, and on horseback they could hunt the giant herds of bison. They followed the buffalo from place to place. The Plains Indians lived in portable houses called TPs, which were made by sowing together buffalo skins and holding them in place with wooden poles. In the southwestern United States some Indians lived by farming. In this dry area the Indians raised several crops such as corn, beans, and squash. Many of the Indians in these areas lived in large settlements where the houses were made from stone or dried mud. The people were experts at weaving and they made clothing and blankets that had beautiful artistic designs. Near the eastern coast of North America many Indians lived by a combination of farming and hunting. These people lived in fortified villages some of which were inhabited for many years at a time. In some places they built large earthworks that can still be seen today. In the forests of northern Canada the Indians lived primarily by hunting, fishing, and gathering. Like the Indians of the prairie regions they often move from place to place in search of game animals to hunt. Today the Indians of North America no longer live in their traditional ways. However several Indian languages are still spoken by many thousands of people. Also many Indians in the United States and Canada are very interested in maintaining the cultural traditions of their ancestors.",205.7143125,143.79164794379582,Ideal

All applicants must meet the following requirements. First of all, applicants must be over 18 years of age. The company apologises, but there can be no exceptions to this rule. Second, persons interested in these positions may not have police records. Minor traffic offenses like a parking ticket are of course no problem. But, end I quote, past and present drug users and sex offenders need not apply. The employer will, of course, check with the police to verify your clean record. In addition, applicants must supply references from past or present employers or teachers along with their recent CV. These references must testify as to the applicant's work habits and or character. Remember, these are references from employers or teachers. A note from your dear old mum won't do. Worldwide Helpers assures me that they will contact these references to confirm they are genuine. Although all positions are volunteer, the employer will reimburse some of your expenses. For example, they will pay for transportation to and from the job site. Aside from that, the cost of phone calls is covered. As for the positions themselves, there are three types. The first involves assisting persons confined to wheelchairs. For this position, volunteers must be physically fit and in excellent health. They must be able to lift at least £150. They should also have a current first aid certificate from the Red Cross. But the most important requirement is that the volunteer must have his own car. On Tuesday afternoons, the volunteers take their clients to various scenic spots around the city to experience and enjoy nature. If you don't drive but you'd still like to get involved, the centre has a number of openings for people to read to the blind. Readers must, of course, read English clearly. Persons with no foreign accent are preferred. For these positions, you must be available on Monday mornings. Oh, wait, I see a note here. There is one opening for someone who can read Urdu. Apparently, there is a Pakistani blind person who'd like to hear his or her native language. But the other positions are all in English. And finally, there are a limited number of volunteers needed to care for disabled children. I'm sorry, but the information I've been given does not say how many children or what disabilities they have. In any case, you are needed to care for the children for one week in August. Apparently, this will be at the close of the summer holiday. I would guess this involves helping them with the routine chores of daily life. Again, volunteers for this position must know basic first aid, being good health and be able to lift up to 75 pounds. All applications for this position have to be submitted no later than Monday, August 8th. Applications may be made either by regular postal service, the snail mail or by email. The mailing address is Worldwide Helpers, Post Office Box 651, East Surrey, BY899C. Please write Attention Mary Smith on the envelope. Or you can send email to ACRAWFOR at worldwidehelpers.org. That's ACRAWFOR at WORLDWIDHELPES.org. So get out there and do something good. Okay, our next announcement is looking for someone to facilitate tiger breeding at the London Zoo.

short-stories-0214-216-babe-didrikson.wav,"Babe Dydriksen Mildred Babe Dydriksen, 1913 to 1956, was one of the most celebrated female athletes of the first half of the 20th century. Competing in the 1930s and 1940s when conventional attitudes regarding women's participation in sport dominated North American culture, Babe Dydriksen rose to fame by dominating not just one, but a number of sports. Dydriksen flouted conventional notions of femininity and proper female activity by excelling in field events such as javelin and shot put, in addition to traditionally male dominated sports such as baseball, swimming, and golf. Interestingly, Dydriksen would always have to battle popular accounts that attacked her question her femininity and sexuality. As a woman with a large muscular and athletic body, Dydriksen was often accused of having an unfair advantage over other women, and often regarded as not being a real woman. Born in the state of Texas, Dydriksen rose to athletic fame quickly, representing the USA in the 1932 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, where she won and set records in the javelin and 80 meter hurdles. Later in her career, Dydriksen turned her athletic attention mainly to golf, as sport in which she was immensely successful. Interestingly, however, Dydriksen tired of the popular innuendo regarding her unfeminine appearance and made a conscious effort to change her image in favor of a more traditionally feminine one. She dawned dresses and makeup in place of her sweatpants and makeupless appearance. Dydriksen's controversial career underwent a twist when she fought the American Athletic Union, AAU, which had stripped her of her amateur sports status after she allowed her image to be used in endorsements for cars. When offered amateur status reinstatement, Dydriksen refused, challenging what she believed to be the AAU's antiquated rules and regulations. Aside from her incredible athletic accomplishments, Dydriksen is an important historical figure because of the challenge she made to the male dominated institution of sport. Dydriksen challenged those within the institution of sport to question gender values at a time when the political environment made it difficult to do so. Dydriksen prefigured by several decades the challenges to sport made by other female athletes, such as Billie Jean King, Martine Navratelova, and Florence Griffith Joyner. Dydriksen forced a re-examination of the meaning of sports, making many aware of the social and political importance of an institution typically not thought of as such.",146.9649375,160.44643301399697,Fast

short-stories-0286-911.wav,"9-11 September 11, 2001, or 9-11, is a day that many people will never forget. It was a Tuesday morning when four planes were hijacked by terrorists, leading to devastating attacks in the U.S. Two planes hit the World Trade Center in New York City, another hit the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. and the fourth after a heroic effort by passengers crashed in a field in Pennsylvania. This tragic event claimed nearly 3,000 lives and marked a huge shift in how the world sees security, terrorism, and international relations. For many Americans, 9-11 is a day of shock, sadness, and reflection. It's not just about the towers falling, but also about the stories of bravery. Firefighters, police officers, and regular people stepped up in ways that were truly inspiring. In the aftermath, the country came together, and there was a feeling of unity that cut across all backgrounds. However, the ripple effects of 9-11 were huge. It changed travel forever. If you've flown recently, you're familiar with the long security lines, shoe removal, and strict liquid rules. It also led to major political shifts. The U.S. launched a global war on terror, leading to military campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq. In addition to that, there was the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, which basically overhauled how America handles security. But it's not all about laws and wars. 9-11 also brought up big questions about personal freedom, privacy, and the role of government in keeping us safe. The USA Patriot Act, for example, gave the government more power to track and monitor potential threats, which raised eyebrows about how much is too much when it comes to surveillance. On a cultural level, the event left its mark, too. It shaped movies, books, and conversations about the world we live in. Sadly, it also sparked a rise in fear and mistrust towards certain communities, especially Muslims and people from the Middle East. This led to incidents of discrimination and hate crimes, which is a darker part of the post 9-11 story. 9-11 was a day that altered the course of history, and while it brought about difficult times, it also showed us how people can come together in the face of adversity.

It was a good day to go to the beach. I drove to a pick your own farm where people can pick their own fruit and buy it. There the fruit is very fresh and delicious. The owner of the farm gave everyone a row to pick their strawberries. The garden was wearing sun hats. I knelt down on the straw between the rows and picked the big juicy red berries. I tasted one. It was warm from the sun. When I bit into it, the juice was sweet and strong. When three big peels were full, I went to pay for them and picked up some recipes for some strawberry desserts. I packed two of the peels in a cooler with some ice, and the other one we would eat at the beach. I met my daughter at the beach. She had a soft pink blanket on the sand. This beach is beside a lake, and across the lake, about 50 kilometers away, the large city can sometimes be seen. Today the wind blew cooler air across the lake over the people on the beach. There were children playing in the water. One man helped his son dig holes in the sand, and the water ran into the holes. One lady held her children's hands and walked down into the water. Families climbed over the rocks and sat on the last rock where the water was deep. Teenagers rode bicycles and roller blades along the path beside the beach. Adults walked and ran along this path, carrying water bottles around their wastes. She sat on the blanket and ate sandwiches of meat and lettuce and strawberries from the pale. We talked and read books and lay in the sun relaxing. We wore sunscreen, but our skin was getting hot. How cold was the water? We walked across the sand that almost burned our feet to the edge of the water. She went right in and lay down floating. I put my toes in and felt the chill through my body. I went up to my knees, then my thighs, but that was far enough. My whole body was cooled down. I headed back to the blanket to lay in the sun again. Soon it was time to go home. She was coming to my house for supper. We drove down the highway with the windows open and our hair blowing in the warm breeze. We cut the strawberries up and made a strawberry dessert with cake and ice cream. We sat outside in the backyard under the maple trees with the birds singing around us and eight-hour supper.

In some countries, it would be legal for a businessman to pollute the land, sea, and air to confine his workers to barracks and to hire children to work in factories. But these things may not be right. On the other hand, it may be illegal for a businessman to do some good things. For example, his society may expect him to treat people unequally and discriminate against some ethnic or religious groups. In order to know what is right or wrong, we need a moral rule. This rule does not come from business itself, but from ethics. So we need a statement of what we believe to be right. The American Declaration of Independence in 1776 states an ethical principle. We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal. The Declaration further tells us that all men have a right to, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Principles such as these can be used in American politics and law to decide whether an action is right or wrong. Many companies have their own ethical guidelines. IBM, for example, outlines its corporate ethics underheadings such as tips, gifts, and entertainment. Accurate reporting, fair competition, and not boasting. So each employee knows what to do or not to do in various situations. Ethical choices are made on three levels. Individuals by companies and by societies make them. An individual might choose whether or not to accept a bribe. A company might decide whether or not to bribe government officials. A government or society might decide whether or not to outlaw bribery. Similar principles of right and wrong might be used at all three levels. For example, it might be decided that bribery is simply wrong in all situations. On the other hand, it might be decided to view the situation case by case. In other words, there is a strong ethical stand and a more tentative ethical stand. The strong ethical stand applies when you have a basic moral principle and apply it to all situations. For example, you might believe that it was always wrong to let workers handle hazardous substances without any protection. The weaker stand would consider whether it is legal to do so. If it is legal to let workers handle dangerous materials, and this conforms to social expectations, then the weak ethical stand would say, no problem. As long as the law is not broken and no one's generously objects, then everything is okay. However, in ethics, there is a principle called the moral minimum. This principle means that you should never harm another person knowingly. The only exception would be to protect some other people or yourself. So business ethics would say that the businessman who exposes his workers to hazardous chemicals is wrong. He is not practicing the moral minimum.",222.4326875,148.62923418123967,Ideal
short-stories-0211-213-tiger-woods.wav,"Tiger Woods One of the most dramatic moments in golf occurred on April 13th, 1997. On that day, Eldrick Tiger Woods said the young age of 21 won the prestigious master's golf tournament. Not only was Woods the youngest ever to perform the feat, Woods' score of 270 set a record for the tournament. His victory was also seen by many as a symbolic victory over years of racism in the sport of golf and US society in general. Woods' victory in 1997 came just two days after the 50th anniversary of the day American baseball players broke the color barrier in professional baseball. Also Woods' victory came in a sport long recognized for racial exclusion. The Augusta National Golf Club excluded blacks from playing in the master's tournament until 1975 and the Professional Golfers Association only removed its Caucasian's only rule in 1961. Woods was born in the state of Florida in 1975. He rose to fame quickly, winning the US amateur tournament from 1994 to 1996 National Collegiate Athletic Association Champion in 1996 and US Junior Championship from 1991 to 1993. In the first year that Woods turned professional, it is estimated that over 650 million dollars US in extra revenue was generated in golf. Television rating soared in the sport and the Professional Golfers Association negotiated huge contracts with American television networks as a result of Woods' fame. Woods is also negotiated record-breaking private sponsorship deals with major firms such as Nike, Buick, Titleist, American Express and many others. In fact, Woods negotiated deals in the millions even before he turned professional. Truly an international sports celebrity Woods sees himself as someone destined not only to be a great athlete, but also a person who will have some significant social or political impact on the world. It is not clear, however, what that impact will be. But there is little question that he will be one of the, if not the richest athletes in history. Woods is destined not just to be a multi-millionaire, but a billionaire. Harold did by some as the first black champion in a traditionally racially secluded sport. He has also been received more cautiously by those who see the limitations of using black sport stars as role models for youth. Only a tiny fraction of African Americans have even the remote chance of becoming sport stars in any sport, especially golf. The odds in fact are so small that there is a much greater chance of winning a lottery. However, by some accounts, as many as 80% of African American youth aspire to make a living from playing sports. Meanwhile, 45% of African American children live below the poverty line in the US. If the trajectory of Woods's career continue on its current path, it is possible he will satisfy his father's wishes for tiger. To make an impact on the world, it will be spiritual and humanitarian and it will transcend the world of golf.",181.1330625,163.63660830832583,Fast

short-stories-0216-218-new-zealand.wav,"New Zealand. New Zealand is a country that is located in the South Pacific Ocean. The country is made up of two large islands, the North Island and the South Island, which are separated by a narrow channel of water. Although New Zealand has many beautiful mountains and forests, much the land is used for farming. In fact, New Zealand has almost 70 million sheep but only 4 million people. New Zealand's farms are also famous for their delicious fruit, especially apples and kiwi fruit. About 10% of the people who live in New Zealand belong to an ethnic group called the Mari. The Mari came to New Zealand by boats from small Polynesian islands. They arrived about a thousand years ago and lived by farming, hunting and fishing. About 200 years ago, many more people came to New Zealand. These people were from the British Isles and they came to New Zealand to begin farms. Today, most of the people of New Zealand are descended from people who came from Britain. During the 19th century, some wars started between the Maori and the British settlers. After years of fighting, the two sides signed a treaty to end the wars. Today, the Maori have achieved equal rights, but there are still some disagreements about land ownership. In recent years, many more people have come to New Zealand, mostly from Asian countries and from other Pacific islands. There are three large cities in New Zealand. Auckland is the largest city with more than one million people. It is located in the northern part of North Island. The capital city of New Zealand is Wellington. It is located in the southern part of the North Island. The largest city of the South Island is Christ Church. The cities of New Zealand are very modern and clean. Many tourists enjoy visiting the cities of New Zealand, but they also enjoy the beautiful countryside. New Zealand is an excellent place for outdoor recreation, such as climbing or walking. Most of New Zealand has a mild or temperate climate. The summer is not very hot and the winter is not very cold. Because New Zealand is in the southern part of the world, summer begins in December and winter begins in June. The South Island is cooler than the North Island, but both islands have similar amounts of rain. This rain gives a feel and forest of New Zealand a beautiful green color. Each year, many tourists visit New Zealand to experience the beautiful countryside and the interesting cultures of its people.",187.324125,136.76828865475815,Ideal
ielts-listening-0098-cam13-test-1-part-2.wav,"Good evening everyone, my name is Phil Sutton and I'm chairman of the Highways Committee. We've called this meeting to inform members of the public about the new regulations for traffic and parking we're proposing for Granford. I'll start by summarising these changes before we open the meeting to questions. So why do we need to make these changes to traffic systems in Granford? Well, we're very aware that traffic is becoming an increasing problem. It's been especially noticeable with the increase in heavy traffic while they've been building the new hospital. But it's the overall rise in the volume of traffic of all kinds that's concerning us. To date, there's not been any increase in traffic accidents, but that's not something we want to see happen, obviously. We recently carried out a survey of local residents and their responses were interesting. People were very concerned about the lack of visibility on some roads due to cars parked along the sides of the roads. We'd expected complaints about the congestion near the school when parents are dropping off their children or picking them up. But this was on top of the list, and nor were noise and fumes from trucks and lorries, though they were mentioned by some people. We think these new traffic regulations would make a lot of difference, but we still have a long way to go. We've managed to keep our proposals within budget, just so they can be covered by the council. But of course it's no good introducing new regulations if we don't have a way of making sure that everyone abays them, and that's an area we're still working on with the help of representatives from the police force. Okay, so this slide shows a map of the central area of Granford with the high street in the middle and school road on the right. Now we already have a set of traffic lights in the high street at the junction with station road, but we're planning to have another set at the other end at the school road junction to regulate the flow of traffic along the high street. We've decided we definitely need a pedestrian crossing. We considered putting this on school road just outside the school, but in the end we decided that could lead to a lot of traffic congestion, so we decided to locate it on the high street, crossing the road in front of the supermarket. That's a very busy area, so it should help things there. We are proposing some changes to parking. At present parking isn't allowed on the high street outside the library, but we are going to change that and allow parking there, but not at the other end of the high street near school road. There'll be a new no parking sign on school road, just by the entrance to the school for bidding parking for 25 metres. This should improve visibility for drivers and pedestrians, especially on the bend just to the north of the school. As far as disabled drivers are concerned, at present they have parking outside the supermarket, but lorries also use those spaces, so we've got two new disabled parking spaces on the side road up towards the bank. It's not ideal, but probably better than the present arrangement. We also plan to widen the pavement on school road. We think we can manage to get an extra half metre on the bend just before we get to the school, on the same side of the road. Finally, we've introduced new restrictions on loading and unloading for the supermarket, so lorries will only be allowed to stop there before 8am. That's the supermarket on school road. We kept to the existing arrangements with the high street supermarket. Okay, so that's about it.",256.238125,148.68981733299836,Ideal

short-stories-0283-287-christmas-holidays.wav,"Christmas holidays. In many ways Christmas is the most important holiday in North America. It is the most important commercial festival. Most retail stores do half their annual business in the six weeks or so before Christmas. Christmas is an important holiday from work and school. Many workers take the whole week off between Christmas and New Year's Day. It is the biggest time of the year for parties, gift giving, home decorations and visiting. Many homeowners compete to see who can have the best display of lights. It is also an important time for the entertainment industry. Many Christmas movies, TV shows, recordings, concerts and plays are produced every year for the Christmas season. It is also the time of year when the largest number of people attend church. Because Christmas is a religious festival too. It celebrates the birth of Jesus. How all these different things came together to become Christmas is a long story. Why, for example, is Jesus' birthday celebrated on December 25th? No one knows the exact day that Jesus was born, but Jesus was born during the Roman Empire. And for the Romans, December 25th was a very important day. The Romans had many gods and many religions. Two religions, both of which had one main god, were the worship of the invincible sun and mithras. These gods were both honored on December 25th. Because December 25th was just after the shortest day of the year, it was a natural time to worship the sun. December was also a time to celebrate the end of the agriculture year. The Romans held one of their main festivals, the Saturnalia, beginning on December 17th. That lasted for a week. The Romans also began the custom of celebrating New Year's Day on January 1st. So the last half of December and the beginning of January was a wonderful time for partying and games. The early Christians didn't know what day Jesus was born. At first they celebrated his birthday on January 6th. However, as most people in the Roman Empire were becoming Christians, it was decided to move the date to December 25th. The celebration lasted 12 days until January 6th and took the place of all other festivals. That way, people who were used to celebrating on December 25th would feel more comfortable. As different peoples became Christians, they brought their own customs to be part of Christmas. The people of Northern Europe used evergreen trees and mistletoe as symbols of spring and eternal life. The evergreen tree became the Christmas tree. The mistletoe is hung from the ceiling at Christmas for couples to kiss under. It was also in Northern Europe where the idea of Santa Claus or Father Christmas began. In Roman times there was a man who became known as Saint Nicholas. He is said to have given gifts to the poor and provided dowries for poor girls who wouldn't otherwise be able to marry. The idea of the gift-giving saint became joined with the Northern idea of spirit of Christmas festivities. It was a poem written in 1831 by the American writer Clement Moore, which popularized Santa Claus throughout the world. Twas the night before Christmas. Told the story of how Santa visits every house in the world and Christmas Eve and brings toys for good girls and boys. Since that time, parents have secretly bought toys for their children at Christmas. When the children awake on Christmas day, they find toys by the chimney or under the Christmas tree. They are told that Santa Claus and his reindeer brought them. Adults also give gifts to each other at Christmas time. No wonder that the store sells so many things then. It is often said that Christmas is becoming too commercialized. In the rush to get everything ready to buy the gift, decorate the house and tree, give parties, visit family and friends at attend special Christmas events, the original reason for celebrating is sometimes forgotten. Only when people go to church or sing Christmas carols or attend musical performances about Jesus' birth, do they remember that Christmas is the birthday of Christ.",247.5625,167.4728603887907,Fast

short-stories-0260-263-currier-and-ives.wav,"Courier and Ives Before the widespread use of photography, there was a large market for artistic depictions of scenes and events. A process for making prints called lithography became popular in North America during the early 19th century. One young artist who mastered this technique was Nathaniel Courier, 1813-1888. Courier opened his own shop in 1834. Courier's success came when he issued prints of newsworthy events. His ruins of the merchants exchange followed a great fire in New York, December 1834. One of Courier's prints of a disastrous fire on a steamboat was published in the New York Sun in 1840. There was also a large market for decorative prints. People who couldn't afford oil paintings would buy color prints to put on their walls. Some of these prints were copies of paintings. Sometimes Courier mentioned his source and sometimes not. In 1852, James Merritt Ives, 1824-1895, joined Courier's firm. In 1857, he became Courier's partner. After that, the firm was known as Courier and Ives. Altogether, the firm produced about 7,000 different subjects. Small prints sold for about 25 cents and large color prints for about $3. Traveling salesmen went from house to house selling them. Courier and Ives sometimes hired the original painters to make the print. More often, someone from their own studio either composed an original subject or copied an existing painting or drawing. Contemporary news remained popular. Courier and Ives prints included the first appearance of Jenny Lind in America, 1850. The fall of Richmond, Virginia, 1865, and the great fire at Chicago, 1871. A common subject was a patriotic scene from American history. Interesting occupations such as wailing, bird hunting, trapping, pertrading, and deep sea fishing were portrayed. Pioneer and Indian topics were in demand. However, the most popular of all scenes were winter and holiday prints of ordinary people enjoying life. Farm scenes, buggy rides, slay rides, market scenes, blacksmiths shops, and town scenes sold well. Favorite prints included American Forest scene, maple sugaring, 1860. Home to Thanksgiving, 1863. Winter in the country, 1862. Life in the country, the morning ride, 1859. And American winter sports, 1856. These scenes are still popular. Even today, you can buy Christmas cards with Courier and Ives winter scenes. This collection of prints gives a remarkable picture of America between 1934 and 1907. Although the prints are sometimes more romantic than reality, they give a lot of information about everyday life. They depict styles of clothing, trains and boats, buildings and bridges, and popular activities. They also tell us what sorts of scenes people at that time liked and what their artistic tastes were. Eventually advances in photography made this kind of printmaking obsolete. In 1906, the firm of Courier and Ives closed its doors for a while these prints were not considered very valuable. Nowadays, however, there are many collectors and Courier and Ives prints once again can be found decorating North American homes.",203.99025,143.53627195417428,Ideal
short-stories-0209-211-participaction.wav,"Participation. Participation was the name of the Canadian government program designed to encourage Canadians to get and stay physically fit. Created in 1971 by the federal government, Participation was successful in encouraging Canadians to be active and to stay healthy. Participation was created by the Canadian Liberal Government of Prime Minister Pierre Toudal. Toudal believed that sport and recreation should play an important role in the lives of Canadian citizens. His government took two steps towards the accomplishment of this goal. First, a government agency was created to provide funds for high performance athletes, such as those training and competing in the Olympic Games. A second agency was created to encourage participation and physical activity in the general Canadian population. It was out of this second agency that participation was born. Participation became famous in the 1970s because of a series of television commercials. In these commercials, a young Canadian in his 20s was seen being outrun by a 60-year-old Swedish man. The message was that Canadians had become lazy and inactive. This was probably true of Canadians at the time. Physical fitness was not highly encouraged in schools, especially for women. Also, the government played little role in encouraging physical activity before participation. The result of participation was impressive. Canadians became more active in the years following the program's inception. Also, fitness and activity were encouraged through physical education programs. Participation was seen as a positive program because it got Canadians active while reducing healthcare costs caused by inactivity and poor physical conditioning. Recently, participation was terminated by the federal government because of a lack of funding. Many people thought this was a shame given the positive messages the program gave to otherwise inactive Canadians. Despite the program's termination, participation has made a long-lasting impression on Canadians. Hopefully, its positive example of physical fitness for Canadians will continue in the future.",127.347,146.99992932695707,Ideal

ielts-listening-0115-cam12-test-1-part-3.wav,"Okay Stuart, we need to start planning our paper on public libraries. Have you thought of an angle yet? Well, there's so much we could look into how libraries have changed over the centuries for instance, or how different countries organise them. What do you think, Judy? Maybe we should concentrate on this country and try and relate the changes in libraries to external developments, like the fact that far more people can read than a century ago, and that the local population may speak lots of different languages? We could include something about changes in the source of funding too. Yes, but remember we're only supposed to write a short paper, so it's probably best if we don't go into funding in any detail. Right. Well, should we just brainstorm a few ideas to get started? Okay. We obviously need to look at the impact of new technology, particularly the internet. Now that lots of books have been digitalised, people can access them from their own computers at home. And if everyone did that, libraries would be obsolete. Yes. But the digitalised books that are available online for free are mostly out of copyright, aren't they? And copyright in this country lasts for 70 years after the author dies, so you won't find the latest best seller or up-to-date information. That's an important point. Anyway, I find it hard to concentrate when I'm reading a long text on a screen. I'd much rather read a physical book, and it takes longer to read on a screen. Oh, I prefer it. I suppose it's just a personal preference. I expect the libraries will go on evolving in the next few years. Some have already become centres where community activities take place, like local clubs meeting there. I think that will become even more common. I'd like to think so, and that they'll still be serving their traditional function, but I'm not so sure. There are financial implications after all. What I'm afraid will happen is that books and magazines will all disappear, and they'll just be rows and rows of computers. They won't look anything like the libraries we're used to. Well, we'll see. I've just had an idea. Why don't we make an in-depth study of our local public libraries background to our paper? Yes, that'll be interesting. And raise all sorts of issues. Let's make a list of possible things we could ask about. Then work out some sort of structure. For instance, we could interview some of the staff, and find out whether the library has its own budget, or if that's controlled by the local council. And what their policies are. I know they don't allow food, but I'd love to find out what types of noise they ban. There always seems to be a lot of talking, but never music. I don't know if that's a policy or it just happens. I've often wondered. Then there are things like how the library is affected by employment laws. I suppose there are rules about working hours, facilities for staff and so on. Right. Then there are other issues relating to the design of the building and how customers use it. Like what measures does the library take to ensure their safety? They'd need floor coverings that aren't slippery. And emergency exits, for instance. Oh, and another thing. There's the question of the kind of insurance the library needs to have in case anyone gets injured. Yes, that's something else to find out. You know something I've often wondered. What's that?

ielts-listening-0178-cam8-test-1-part-2.wav,"Hello, and thank you for asking me to your teachers meeting to talk about the Dinosaur Museum and to tell you a bit about what you can do with your students there. Well, let me give you some of the basic information first. In regard to opening hours, we're open every day of the week from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. except on Mondays when we close at 1.30 p.m. and in fact the only day in the year when we're closed is on 25th of December. You can book a guided tour for your school group anytime that we're open. If you bring a school group to the museum, when you arrive we ask you to remain with your group in the car park. One or more of the tour guides will welcome you there and brief you about what the tour will be about. We do this there because our entrance is quite small and we really haven't got much room for briefing groups in the exhibition area. As far as the amount of time your need goes, if you bring a school group, you should plan on allowing a minimum of 90 minutes for the visit. This allows 15 minutes to get on and off the coach, 45 minutes for the guided tour and 30 minutes for after tour activities. If you're going to have lunch at the museum, you will of course have to allow more time. There are two cafes in the museum with seating for 80 people. If you want to eat there, you'll need to reserve some seating as they can get quite crowded at lunchtime. Outside the museum, at the back, there are tables and students can bring their own lunch and eat it there in the open air. When the students come into the museum foyer, we ask them to check in their backpacks with their books, lunch boxes, etc. at the cloakroom before they enter the museum proper. I'm afraid in the past we have had a few things gone missing after school visits, so this is a strict rule. Also, some of the exhibits are fragile and we don't want them to be accidentally knocked. But we do provide school students with handouts, with questions and quizzes on them. There's so much that students can learn in the museum and it's fun for them to have something to do. Of course, they'll need to bring something to write with for these. We do allow students to take photographs. For students who are doing projects, it's useful to make some kind of visual record of what they see that they can add to their reports. And finally, they should not bring anything to eat into the museum or drinks of any kind. There are also a few things that students can do after the tour. In the theatreette on the ground floor, there are continuous screenings of short documentaries about dinosaurs which they can see at any time. We used to have an activity room with more interactive things like making models of dinosaurs and drawing and painting pictures, even hunting for dinosaur eggs. But unfortunately, the room was damaged in a bad storm recently when water came in the roof, so that's closed at the moment. But we do have an IT centre where students have access to CD-ROMs with a range of dinosaur games. These games are a lot of fun, but they also teach the students about the lives of dinosaurs, how they found food, protected their habitat, survived threats, that kind of thing. And I think that's all I have to tell you. Please feel free to ask any questions if you would like to know anything else about it.",226.719875,165.13770572606396,Fast
short-stories-0274-277-thanksgiving-day.wav,"Thanksgiving Day Thanksgiving Day has a special meaning for Americans. Many holidays were brought along from Europe by the early settlers and didn't change very much. But Thanksgiving takes on a special shape in North America. That is because of the Thanksgiving celebrated by the early pilgrim settlers in Massachusetts in 1621. These early settlers were from England and they were known as Puritans. This is because they wanted to purify the state religion of England. They felt that the churches were more concerned with politics and customs than God and worship. They were also called pilgrims because they were willing to travel to other countries in order to worship God the way they wanted to. When the English government put some of the pilgrims in jail, the rest left England and went to the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, they could have their own churches. However, it was hard to earn a living there and at first they didn't know the language. In time, the English king learned where they were and tried to have them arrested. So they thought of another plan. Pilgrim leaders like William Brewster attempted to raise money to start a colony in North America. They would have to borrow money and pay it back later. Thirty members of the Pilgrim Church in the Netherlands voted to sail to America with their families. They returned to England and set sail on two ships, the Speedwell and the Mayflower. When the Speedwell appeared unable to cross the ocean, both ships returned to England. All who still wanted to sail crowded into the Mayflower and set sail on September 6, 1620. Many of the passengers became sick during the long voyage and some died. They encountered fear storms because they were sailing late in the season. After 66 days, they cited the sandy shoreline of Cape Cod in present-day Massachusetts. There was disagreement between the Pilgrims and others on board ship about what to do. So first they had to agree to a common form of a government and elected governor. Since winter was coming, they decided to stay on the ship till spring. About half of the remaining settlers died during the first winter. When the Mayflower sailed back to England, only about 50 settlers were left. Nearly half of these were children. There were Indians in Massachusetts, but at first they were not friendly. They shot arrows at the settlers. But one day a friendly Indian named Samaset came to visit them. He spoke English and could tell the many things. He brought another Indian named Squanto, who showed the Pilgrims how to plant corn. Eventually their chief Massasoid came and he promised to keep peaceful relations with the settlers. All spring and summer of 1621, the Pilgrims worked hard in the fields. They also finished building houses and barns. In the fall they were delighted to see that the corn and vegetables had grown well. They decided to have a Thanksgiving feast and invited their Indian friends. On the day of the feast, chief Massasoid came with 90 Indians. They were turkeys, deer meat, and fish to eat. The feast lasted three days. When the food ran low, the Indians went out to shoot more birds and animals. The Pilgrims and Indians competed in races, wrestling, shooting and other games. The Pilgrims addressed prayers and thanks to God for providing food, shelter, freedom of religion, and friendly Indians in this new land. Ever since 1621, Thanksgiving celebrations include memories of that special occasion. Today, turkeys, cranberries, corn and squash are usually part of the Thanksgiving meal. In the United States, Thanksgiving Day is a national holiday. It celebrated every year on the fourth Thursday in November. In Canada, where the harvest is earlier, Thanksgiving is celebrated on the second Monday of October. The celebration always includes giving thanks for the good things that people have received, especially for food and families. Along with this goes the Thanksgiving meal, when so many good things are eaten.",221.2310625,181.71046843840023,Fast

short-stories-0282-286-charlotte-church.wav,"Charlotte Church Many years ago, a German opera in Priserio was asked why so many of his leading ladies were physically unattractive. He replied, the ones who look like horses sing like nightingales and vice versa. Certainly a good voice doesn't always go with an attractive appearance, but an hour day of media images, good looks, seemed very important. Charlotte Church recorded her first album when she was 12 years old. It was called Voice of an Angel. Everyone agreed that little girl has a very big voice, and they were delighted that Charlotte not only sounded like an angel, she also looked like one. Her sweet schoolgirl appearance and winning smile are part of her success. Charlotte Church was born in Cardiff, Wales in February 1986. Music and singing are very important in Welsh culture, and all of Charlotte's family were musical. Although Wales is part of Great Britain, the Welsh people are very proud of their own language, history and heritage. Now that Wales has its own Parliament in Cardiff, Welsh culture is promoted even more strongly. Charlotte sings some of her songs in the Welsh language. Charlotte began singing along with the radio as an infant, and by the age of three she could sing a number of popular songs. She began singing lessons when she was nine. Charlotte first appeared on television early in 1997. This led to a number of other TV and concert appearances. In 1998, she signed a contract with Sony to record five albums. Since Charlotte's first album appeared, she has spent a lot of time doing promotional tours. Since she's a schoolgirl, her two tutors travel along with her. Voice of an Angel was recorded in five days in Cardiff, Wales. All the songs were ones that Charlotte already knew and liked. These included Pai Jesus, the Lord's Prayer, Jerusalem and Danny Boy. The album came out on November 9, 1998, and within a couple of weeks was number four on the popular music charts. She recorded her second album, Charlotte Church, in 1999. Traveling involves doing showcases for people in the music industry and the media. This is to encourage people to promote your music. She also appeared on various US talk shows, including David Letterman and Jay Leno. She finds that she gets asked the same questions over and over again. Besides media celebrities, Charlotte has met many leading public figures. Since she is a Roman Catholic, Charlotte was especially excited to meet the Pope. This was after she'd been invited to sing at a Christmas concert at the Vatican. She was also asked to sing at Prince Charles' 50th Birthday Party in 1998. She saw the Prince again in 1999 when she sang at the official opening of the Welsh National Assembly. Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip talked to her too. Later that year, she sang for Bill and Hillary Clinton at the Ford Theatre in Washington. Something that people like about Charlotte Church is that when she hasn't been spoiled by fame, many show business kids are loud, brash, noisy and rude. But when she is away from the stage, the young singer leads a normal life with her family and friends. And when she is on TV, she comes across as an ordinary teenager, but a very nice one. Charlotte's voice always gets comments. It seems like such a big voice for a little girl. Very few teenagers have a powerful, operatic voice like hers. Some people have found it hard to believe that it is actually Charlotte singing. For the most part, she enjoys her success. She likes to travel and meet new people. Los Angeles is her favorite city, and she likes the United States and Canada. She is always glad to get home to Wales and be with her friends. At the moment, she goes to an all-girl school, so she doesn't see boys very often. But at age 15, an interest in boys is likely to become a factor in her life. Charlotte now has recorded three albums, and we can expect a fourth in 2001. She also has written an account of her life for all her fans. It is entitled Voice of an Angel. My Life.

short-stories-0197-198-doctors-without-borders.wav,"Doctors Without Borders In 1999, the Nobel Prize for Peace was won by the organization known as Doctors Without Borders. This is the English name for the organization, based in Belgium, which won the prize for its humanitarian assistance to people around the world, in areas that have been struck by disaster. The fundamental ideas of Doctors Without Borders is that people who suffer from a disaster have the right to receive professional help as soon as possible. The organization helps people regardless of their nationality, race, religion, ethnicity, sex, or political opinions. Also, the assistance provided by Doctors Without Borders is given a response to all kinds of disasters such as famines, earthquakes, and wars. The people who belong to Doctors Without Borders are experienced medical workers who volunteer their time, effort, and skills in an attempt to help people who are in need. These volunteers include doctors, nurses, surgeons, and nest assists, laboratory technicians, and other medical workers. There are also some non-medical volunteers who work for Doctors Without Borders in positions of administration or logistics. Volunteers must first take a course before participating in a humanitarian mission. They promise to abide by a code of professional ethics, and they promise to remain neutral in any conflicts within a disaster area. A mission typically lasts about six months, but the duration varies. The volunteers are insured by the organization, but they are not paid in any way for their work. When Doctors Without Borders began in 1971, it consisted of only a few French doctors who wanted to provide humanitarian aid to people in disaster areas. Over the years, it grew rapidly, and by 2001 Doctors Without Borders had 2500 volunteers working in 80 countries around the world. They have helped people by providing emergency healthcare, vaccinations, medicine, water, and basic food, and also by developing improved water and sanitation systems. In many areas, Doctors Without Borders has also helped to provide basic medical training to local people. Although Doctors Without Borders remains neutral in any conflicts within a disaster area, the organization does speak out against abuses of human rights. By remaining independent of the influence of governments and corporations, Doctors Without Borders is able to criticize the people and organizations who cause suffering. The volunteers are witnesses who tell the world about the cruelty that is inflicted upon innocent people. Obviously, the work of Doctors Without Borders is extremely important. The volunteers of this organization are brave and selfless people whose efforts have relieved the suffering of millions of people.",193.1494375,131.7114889345717,Ideal

short-stories-0180-181-hawaii.wav,"Hawaii. Of the 50 states in the United States, 49 are located on the mainland of North America. The other state is Hawaii, which consists of several islands in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Hawaii is known as an especially beautiful and interesting place. The Hawaiian Islands were formed by volcanic eruptions that pushed molten rock called lava above the surface of the ocean. Some of the islands no longer have any volcanic activity, but there are still active volcanoes on two Hawaiian islands, Oahu and the big island, which is known simply as Hawaii. One of these volcanoes, Manaloa, still erupts sometimes with spectacular explosions of lava. Another volcano, called Monakia, is now dormant. These volcanoes are both very tall and reach over 4000 meters above sea level. The air above Monakia is so clear and thin that scientists use the mountain as a base for observing the stars. The islands of Hawaii are located in the tropics, and they are known for their beautiful weather. The temperatures are usually in the range of 20 to 30 degrees Celsius, and the days are usually sunny. This weather allows people to enjoy swimming and surfing on the beautiful beaches of Hawaii. Despite the sunshine, most of the islands also receive enough rainfall to support many beautiful flowers and trees. The first people to live in Hawaii were Polynesian groups who arrived from other islands in the Pacific, well over 1000 years ago. The islands were visited by European explorers during the late 18th century. During the early 19th century, the islands became unified under a single king. However, during this time, many Hawaiians died from diseases that were brought by European and American visitors. The Hawaiian Islands are excellent places for growing sugarcane and pineapples. In the late 18th century, some Americans began large farms, called plantations in Hawaii. The Americans eventually gained control of the government, and Hawaii became a territory of the United States. The United States built a naval base on the island of Oahu at Pearl Harbor. This base was attacked by Japan in 1941, but it was soon repaired. The naval base is still in use today. During the 19th and 20th centuries, there were great demand for labor on the sugar and pineapple plantations. People came to Hawaii from many lands, and Hawaii became a place of many cultures. The native Hawaiians mixed with people from places such as Japan, China, Korea, the Philippines, Portugal, and Puerto Rico, as well as the mainland United States. Today, many Hawaiians can claim a diverse heritage. In 1959, Hawaii became the 50th state of the United States, with the city of Honolulu as its capital. Today, there are more than 1 million people in Hawaii, more than half of whom live in Honolulu. Each year, many more people visit Hawaii as tourists to experience the beauty of these islands.",205.0976875,141.29852146675228,Ideal
ielts-listening-0136-cam11-test-2-part-4.wav,"We've been discussing the factors the architect has to consider when designing domestic buildings. I'm going to move on now to consider the design of public buildings, and I'll illustrate this by referring to the new Taylor concert hall that's recently been completed here in the city. So, as with a domestic building, when designing a public building, an architect needs to consider the function of the building. For example, is it to be used primarily for entertainment, or for education, or for administration? The second thing the architect needs to think about is the context of the building. This includes its physical location, obviously, but it also includes the social meaning of the building, how it relates to the people it's built for. And finally, for important public buildings, the architect may also be looking for a central symbolic idea on which to base the design, a sort of metaphor for the building and the way in which it is used. Let's look at the new Taylor concert hall in relation to these ideas. The location chosen was a site in a rundown district that has been ignored in previous redevelopment plans. It was occupied by a factory that has been empty for some years. The whole area was some distance from the high-rise office blocks of the central business district and shopping centre, but it was only one kilometre from the ring road. The site itself was bordered to the north by a canal, which had once been used by boats springing in raw materials when the area was used for manufacturing. The architect chosen for the project was Tom Harrison. He found the main design challenge was the location of the site in an area that had no neighbouring buildings of any importance. To reflect the fact that the significance of the building in this quite rundown location was as yet unknown, he decided to create a building centered around the idea of a mystery, something whose meaning still has to be discovered. So, how was this reflected in the design of the building? Well, Harrison decided to create pedestrian access to the building and to make use of the presence of water on the site. As people approached the entrance, they therefore have to cross over a bridge. He wanted to give people a feeling of suspense as they see the building first from a distance and then close up. And the initial impression he wanted to create from the shape of the building as a whole was that of a box. The first side that people see, the southern wall, is just a high flat wall uninterrupted by any windows. This might sound off-putting, but it supports Harrison's concept of the building, that the person approaching is intrigued and wonders what will be inside. And this flat wall also has another purpose. At night time, projectors are switched on and it functions as a huge screen onto which images are projected. The auditorium itself seats 1,500 people. The floors supported by ten massive pads. These are constructed from rubber and so are able to absorb any vibrations from outside and prevent them from affecting the auditorium. The walls are made of several layers of honey-coloured wood, all sourced from local beach trees. In order to improve the acoustic properties of the auditorium and to amplify the sound, they are not straight, they are curved. The acoustics are also adjustable according to the size of orchestra and the type of music being played. In order to achieve this, there are nine movable panels in the ceiling above the orchestra which are all individually motorised. And the walls also have curtains which can be opened or closed to change the acoustics. The reaction of the public to the new building has generally been positive. However, the evaluation of some critics has been less enthusiastic. In spite of Harrison's efforts to use local materials, they criticise the style of the design as being international rather than local. And say it doesn't reflect features of the landscape or society for which it is built.",289.6104375,141.91477473942908,Ideal

short-stories-0195-196-the-automobile-or-car.wav,"The automobile or car? In many ways, the automobile has been one of the most important inventions of the modern age. People have been able to travel much more freely and across much greater distances than was possible in the past. The automobile, which most people refer to as the car, has also had some harmful consequences, such as pollution and accidents. However, it is clear that life has changed profoundly as a result of the car. Modern cars are very complicated, but the basic idea of how a car works can be described briefly. When the keys are turned in the ignition of the car, this creates a spark that ignites some gasoline vapor inside a cylinder. Then, the rapid expansion of this vapor pushes against a part called a piston. The movement of the piston then causes a turning motion in a shaft that is connected to the wheels. The wheels turn and the car moves. The invention of the car and the engines used by cars happened gradually in the late 19th century, mainly in France and Germany. In the early 20th century, an American engineer named Henry Ford developed a new way of making cars. Instead of having one worker produce an entire car, he had each worker perform one part of the production of many different cars. This system was very efficient and allowed the mass production of cars. The first car to be produced in large numbers was called the Model T. The Model T Ford and other cars that were soon produced in large numbers were cheap enough that many people could afford to buy them. Many new roads were built and paved throughout North America to allow cars to be driven from town to town. People were able to travel much more easily and to visit places that had previously been difficult to reach. Some problems also came with the widespread use of cars. One of these problems was air pollution because car engines burned gasoline, which produces poisonous exhaust fumes. Gradually new laws and new technology have led to reductions in the air pollution that is caused by cars. Moreover, cars today are much more fuel efficient than they were in the past, requiring less gasoline to travel a given distance. However, this pollution is still a problem because of the many millions of cars that are used each day. Another problem has been car accidents, which have caused many thousands of deaths each year. During the 1960s, some journalists brought attention to the unsafe features of many cars. As a result, the safety of cars has been greatly improved. In addition, the use of seatbelts is now required by law. However, car accidents continue to be a serious problem. The future is likely to bring many interesting new changes to the car. Improvements in the safety of cars, in fuel efficiency, and in the cleanliness of car emissions are continuing to be made. Also, the increasing use of the car in economically developing countries will probably have important effects upon people's lives around the world.",207.699625,148.77253630092014,Ideal

ielts-listening-0324-ielts-recent-actual-test-33-part-4.wav,"Good morning and welcome to yet another lecture in environmental science. I don't think I'm telling you a secret when I mention that water is a big worry here in Australia. The stuff is scarce. Perhaps that's why we drink so much beer, eh? Seriously though, a safe and reliable source of water is one of the great concerns of people everywhere. Moreover, as the world population grows, the pressure on existing water supplies grows greater and greater. Think about it. Our economic system demands that there be more and more consumers. The growing number of people has been tied to climate change, including droughts. So more people means less water. But our economic system demands a high birth rate. Forget about oil. Soon enough you will see wars for water. Mark my words. But today I'm going to confine my remarks to Australia. As noted already, here down under the water supplies extremely scarce. The only dry continent is Antarctica. And remember, no one really lives there anyway. Moreover, in recent years, the wind patterns have changed. Rain that used to fall on the country now falls out to see hundreds of miles to the south. Now when I speak of people needing water, most of you probably think of drinking. Certainly everyone needs water for drinking. But surprising as it may sound, drinking is not anywhere near being the main use for water. Most water is actually used for washing. When you take a shower, you probably use well over 100 litres of water. Every time you flush your toilet, that's about 8 litres. But most people drink no more than 2 litres or so per day. So, where to get water? It could be obtained from rain water. But often rainfall consists of other harmful pollutants that evaporated with the water. In fact, acid rain, an intense example of this, causes harmful effects on the wildlife of the habitat on which it falls. Water from underground could also be used, though it is more difficult to contain and often must go through an extensive cleansing process. The purest water is found in rivers, creeks, lakes and dams. And, sad to say, Australia has precious few of these. Really, how many of your hometowns have rivers? Year-round rivers, I mean. The soil tends to be sandy, so water soaks into the ground. Many places are rocky too, so 87% of the rainfall is lost to evaporation. That's almost twice the evaporation rate in my native Canada. Speaking of rain, we already heard how rainfall is diminishing here in Oceana. The quantity itself isn't the only problem either. Going back to the problems with obtaining rain water, a further problem is that rain is a useful source of water only if air pollution is fairly mild. Again, you're in a situation where you can't win. You need water where most people live, people tend to build cities where rainfall is adequate, but then modern cities tend to feature polluted air, which renders the rain far less easily usable. Okay, let's take a look at the table here. You'll see it showing the relative pollution of rainfall in the world's cities, the more people, the dirty the rain. This is becoming a huge concern for people in the West who want their water to be pure and safe. Though reliable drinking water is important everywhere, the concern in the West is reflected in all the government regulations and political campaigns aimed at solving this problem. In contrast, there are not as many demands made on the governments in Asian and African cultures to improve the water, as their focus is on other issues. Now, whatever the source of water, we can never afford to forget that all water is highly vulnerable to contamination. Whether we're getting it from the ground, from bodies of water or rainfall, it is susceptible to a variety of toxins. In fact, that's why we clean it before using it. Water carries with it filth and dirt. This problem shows up in a number of different ways. As humans and all other animals need water to survive, it's no surprise to us that one of the most important domestic uses of water is for drinking. Yet, if you have old fashioned lead pipes, you may slowly be poisoning yourself by drinking that nice clear water. The industrial pollution, farm chemicals and leaky landfills are well-known sources of contaminants as well. So, what is being done to ensure we Australians are safe and steady supply of drinking water? There are a lot of initiatives that make admirable efforts to remedy this issue. We'll be talking about this when we meet again on Thursday, but as a preview, I can tell you that so far the amount of real solutions that have been produced is not nearly adequate. Traditionally, we've been very free in this country. That means that every person and every province tend to go its own way. So, the mechanisms for water management are in a word insufficient. To begin seeing how this is so, I want you to read something before our next class. There are lots of previous data on water usage and water management are inconclusive and have thus caused quite a concern. We can learn a lot from the contents of reports written on the subject. The basis for the government's water policy is the 1989 white paper reporting on water use, present and future. If you compare the numbers offered in the paper with those in the text, you'll find that the report is rather untrustworthy. Truth being told, I'm being too kind when I say that.",353.3904375,160.78533534173513,Fast

short-stories-0249-252-hernias-repaired-here.wav,"Cornias repaired here. A hernia occurs when there is a tear or weakness in the muscle layers of the abdomen. This allows the intestines to push forward into the gap. Usually the person feels some discomfort and may notice an egg-shaped swelling. In a few cases the muscle layers may clamp down on the protruding intestine and cut off its oxygen supply. This can result in death if medical help is not readily available. Cornias are more common in men than women and are often related to lifting heavy materials. Although most hernias are not a serious threat to health, they usually get worse over time. The only cure is surgery to repair the cut, tear, or weakness. As with any surgery, time in a hospital is usually required for recovery. This proved to be a problem in Canada during World War II. Many young men were declared unfit for military service because they had hernias. During the war there was a shortage of doctors and beds for hernia repair. A Toronto doctor, Dr. Edward Sholdeis, decided to address this problem. He personally operated on 70 of these young men using a technique of his own. This Sholdeis technique allowed the patients a quicker recovery time than the usual method. It also had a much lower rate of complications and failures. After the war, Dr. Sholdeis opened his own herniaclinic for the public. In 1953, a second hospital was started in Thornhill, just north of Toronto, and today all surgery is done there. The Sholdeis hospital is located on a beautiful piece of land with a valley on one side and a golf course on the other. The large grounds have wonderful gardens and flowering trees. There are nature paths for patients to walk on. The building itself is not a regular hospital, but more like a hotel or residence where patients can play the piano, shoot pool, play shuffle board, or practice their putting. The hospital now has 89 beds and an average of 30 hernia operations are performed daily. Since all the surgeons are specialists, their level of skill is very high and less than 1% of operations need to be corrected. The worldwide rate of failure is around 20%. For patients, the good news is that everything at the hospital is directed to repairing their hernia and aiding their recovery as quickly as possible. The staff encourages its patients to walk and exercise within 4 or 5 hours of surgery. The patients usually stay on for several more days until they are fully recovered and ready to go home. Sholdeis' best advertisements are his satisfied customers. Hernia patients come not only from Canada and the United States, but also from many countries of the world to receive the best possible treatment. Sholdeis remains the most famous hospital in the world, devoted entirely to the repair and treatment of hernias.

short-stories-0221-223-cowboys.wav,"Cowboys The Golden Age of the American Cowboy was short-lived. It began in the 1860s with the great cattle drives from Texas, North to Kansas. By 1890, when railroads had reached remote areas, there was no more need for large-scale cattle drives. Of course, cowboys have a history before 1860. In fact, there were Mexican cowboys long before that. The Spanish Conqueror of Mexico, Hernán Cortez, brought cattle with him in 1521. Cortez also branded his cattle with a three-cross design. The Spanish sharp-horned cattle roamed the deserts and prairies freely. Eventually, they found their way to Texas. American settlers in Texas interbred their animals with the Spanish breed. The Texas Longhorn Cow was the result. It was famous for its bad temper and aggressiveness. The Longhorn was a dangerous animal, with each of its horns measuring up to three and one-half feet long. After the American Civil War ended in 1865, disbanded soldiers who were former black slaves and young men seeking adventure headed west. At that time there were about five million cattle in Texas. Back in the east there was a big demand for beef. By this time railways from the east extended as far west as Kansas. It was still more than 600 miles from South Texas to the railway. Between the two places there were rivers to cross, Indian tribes, badlands, and other problems. A fur trader named Jesse Chisholm had driven his wagon north in 1865. Cowboys and cattle followed the Chisholm trail north to Abelene, Kansas. This cattle trail became the most famous route for driving cattle, until it was barbed with barbed wire in 1884. In 1867, cattle dealer Joseph G. McCoy built pens for 3,000 cattle in the little town of Abelene. Soon Abelene was the most dangerous town in America. After the long cattle drive, Cowboys who had just been paid went wild. Here of Wild Bill Hickock, tamed Abelene in 1871 by forcing Cowboys to turn over their guns when they arrived in town. Other towns replaced Abelene as the wildest town in the west, Newton, Wichita, Ellsworth, and Dodge City. In Kansas a herd of 3,000 Texas longhorns might sell for $100,000 making the rancher rich. The Cowboys might get $200 in wages, which often disappeared on drink, women, and gambling. Getting cattle to Kansas was far from easy. One of the biggest difficulties was getting the herd across rivers, especially when the river was high. There were no bridges. In 1871, 350 Cowboys driving 60,000 cattle waited two weeks for the water level in the red river to go down. A herd for man and animals was also difficult to find at times. An early cattleman developed the Chuck Wagon, which were both a supply wagon and a portable kitchen. In the 1870s there were probably 40,000 Cowboys in the west. After the prairies were fenced in, there was less work. Large ranches still employ Cowboys to round up the cattle for branding or for sale. And today, about 20,000 Cowboys still work in North America.",217.0253125,140.72091245116857,Ideal

short-stories-0181-182-charles-darwin.wav,"Charles Darwin Charles Darwin made what might be the most important scientific discovery of all time, the theory of evolution by natural selection. It was Darwin who first understood how it was that plants and animals evolved over time to produce new and different species. At first, this theory faced much opposition, but since that time it has been supported by evidence from many areas of science. Darwin was born in a small town in England in 1809. When he was a young man, he went to university, first to study medicine, and later to study religion. However, Darwin found his schoolwork to be very boring. Instead, he preferred outdoor activities, and was very interested in nature. While Darwin was at university, the British Navy was planning to send one of its ships called the Beagle on a voyage of exploration. As part of this voyage, the ship would need a naturalist who could study the various plants and animals that might be found. Darwin was recommended for this job by one of his professors who had been impressed by Darwin. Darwin was chosen as the naturalist of the Beagle, and the ship left England in 1831. The ship's voyage took Darwin around the world, and he observed many species of plants and animals on his trip. In one place near South America, known as the Galapagos Islands, Darwin observed many unusual species of birds. Several of these birds seemed closely related to each other, but they differed in interesting ways. For example, some birds had long beaks that could reach insects hidden in the bark of trees, and other birds had thick beaks that could break open the shells of nuts. What Darwin realized was that certain characteristics could help an animal or a plant to survive and reproduce. Individuals that lacked those characteristics would become more likely to die without reproducing. Over many generations, the useful characteristics would then become more and more common, as the surviving individuals passed the characteristics onto their offspring. Eventually, after many generations, the changes would be so great that a new species would exist. In this way, a single species could divide into two or more new ones. This was called the process of evolution by natural selection. When Darwin returned to England, he studied plants and animals in more detail. After much research, he began writing a book about his theory of evolution by natural selection. In the book, the origin of species was published in 1859. It was very popular and very controversial. During the next twenty years, Darwin continued his scientific research, and he wrote several more books. By the time of his death in 1882, many biologists said realize that Darwin had made one of the most important scientific discoveries of all time. For the first time, scientists could understand the origin of the many different species of plants and animals.",202.60575,143.0364143169678,Ideal
short-stories-0254-257-the-war-that-both-sides-won.wav,"The war that both sides won. Today, the 3,000-mile boundary between Canada and the United States is known as the longest undefended boundary in the world. But for three years in a row, 1812, 1813, and 1814, US armies invaded Canada. When both sides failed to win a clear victory and the cost of the war kept growing, the two countries decided that peace was the best policy. On June 18, 1812, the United States declared war on Great Britain. The United States have proclaimed their independence from Britain in 1776, 36 years earlier. There were still bad feelings between the two countries. Great Britain was not treating the United States as an equal independent country. British ships were stopping American ships from trading with Europe. British sailors went aboard American ships looking for deserters from the British Navy. If an American sailor could not prove that he was an American, he was taken to work for the British. At the same time, the population of the United States was expanding. Americans wanted to move west into lands held by various American Indian tribes. Some Americans felt that Britain was encouraging the Indians to fight them and was supplying guns to the Indians. In 1812, Canada was made up of a small number of British colonies just north of the American border. Americans felt it would be easy to take over Canada, then Canadian land would provide homes for their growing population. Since Americans outnumbered Canadians 10-1, the US government thought that no one in Canada would dare oppose them. Moreover, Britain was fighting a terrible war in Europe against Napoleon, the emperor of France, and could not spare any troops to help defend Canada. At in 1812, Canada had what advantage over the USA? Good leadership. British general Isaac Brock had served in Canada for 10 years. He knew how to inspire both his own soldiers and the ordinary people of Canada to fight for their country. He was a bold and energetic leader who moved quickly to attack American positions before they could attack him. Brock found a valuable ally in the American Indian chief Tukumsa. Tukumsa had been trying to unite the scattered groups of Indians to fight together against American expansion. He convinced the Indians that their best chance for success was to join the British and Canadians against the Americans. Although both Brock and Tukumsa were killed in battles, their example continued to inspired the defenders of Canada to fight against the American invasions. Before the end of 1814, all American forces had been driven out of Canada. By 1814, Britain had defeated the French emperor Napoleon. Now it was the turn of the United States to be invaded. A large British force attacked the heart of the United States and burned the government buildings at Washington. Another British force attacked the USA near the mouth of the Mississippi River, but it was defeated at the Battle of New Orleans. Both sides were tired of fighting by this time, and a peace treaty was signed on December 24, 1814. This agreement restored everything to the way it had been when the war began. Although this really meant that no one had won the war, both sides claimed victory. The Americans felt that they had gained full recognition of their independence. Britain would no longer board their ships or encourage the Indians to fight them. Canadians felt that they had shown Americans that they wanted to develop their own country in their own way, separate from the United States. But the biggest result of the war was the decision by both countries never to fight each other again.",232.5159375,157.92465839035228,Fast

ielts-listening-0070-cam15-test-2-part-2.wav,"over a century and has been the responsibility of the city council for most of that time. What perhaps isn't so well known is the origin of the park. Unlike many public parks that started in private ownership, as the Garden of a large house, for instance, Minster was some wasteland, which people living nearby started planting with flowers in 1892. It was unclear who actually owned the land, and this wasn't settled until 20 years later when the council took possession of it. You may have noticed the statue near one of the entrances. It's of Diane Gosforth, who played a key role in the history of the park. Once the council had become the legal owner, it planned to sell the land for housing. Many local people wanted it to remain a place that everyone could go to, to enjoy the fresh air and natural environment. Remember, the park is in a densely populated residential area. Diane Gosforth was one of those people, and she organised petitions and demonstrations, which eventually made the council change its mind about the future of the land. Soon after this, the First World War broke out in 1914, and most of the park was dug up and planted with vegetables, which were sold locally. At one stage, the army considered taking it over for true exercises, and got as far as contacting the city council, then decided the park was too small to be of use. There were occasional public meetings during the war, in an area that had been retained as grass. After the war, the park was turned back more or less to how it had been before 1914, and continued almost unchanged until recently. Plans for transforming it were drawn up at various times, most recently in 2013, though they were revised in 2015, before any work had started. The changes finally got going in 2016, and were finished on schedule last year. Okay, let me tell you about some of the changes that have been made, and some things that have been retained. If you look at this map, you'll see the familiar outline of the park, with the river forming the northern boundary, and a gate in each of the other three walls. The statue of Diane Gosforth has been moved. It used to be close to the South Gate, but it's now immediately to the north of the Lillipond, almost in the center of the park, which makes it much more visible. There's a new area of wooden sculptures, which are on the riverbank, where the path from the East Gate makes a sharp bend. There are two areas that are particularly intended for children. The playground has been enlarged and improved, and that's between the river and the path that leads from the pond to the river. Then there's a new maze, a circular series of paths separated by low hedges. That's near the West Gate. You go north from there towards the river, and then turn left to reach it. There have been tennis courts in the park for many years, and they've been doubled, from four to eight. They're still in the southwest corner of the park, where there's a right-angle bend in the path. Something else I'd like to mention is the new fitness area. This is right next to the Lillipond on the same side as the West Gate. Now, as you're all gardeners, I'm sure you'll like to hear about the plants that have been chosen for the park.",267.732,131.99766931110213,Ideal

ielts-listening-0038-cam17-test-2-part-2.wav,"Good morning, and welcome to Onerton Hall, one of the largest estates in the area. My name's Nick, and I'm one of the Guides. I'll give you a brief introduction to the estate while you're sitting down, and then we'll walk round. The estate consists of the house, gardens, parkland, and farm, and it dates back to the 14th century. The original house was replaced in the late 17th century, and of course it has had a large number of owners. Almost all of them have left their mark, generally by adding new rooms, like the ballroom and conservatory, or by demolishing others. The farm looks much as it's always done, although the current owner has done a great deal of work to the flower beds. In the 17th century, the estate was owned by a very wealthy man called Sir Edward Downes. His intention was to escape from the world of politics, after years as an active politician, and to build a new house worthy of his big collection of books, paintings, and sculptures. He broke off contact with his former political allies and hosted meetings of creative and literary people, like painters and poets. Unusually for his time, he didn't care whether his guests were rich or poor, as long as they had talent. Big houses like Onniton had dozens of servants until the 1920s or 30s, and we've tried to show what their working lives were like. Photographs, of course, don't give much of an idea, so instead, as you go round the house, you'll see volunteers dressed up as 19th century servants going about their work. They'll explain what they're doing, and tell you their recipes, or what tools they're using. We've just introduced this feature to replace the audio guide we used to have available. I see there are a number of children here with you today. Well we have several activities, especially for children, like dressing up in the sorts of clothes that children wore in the past. And as it's a fine day, some of you will probably want to play in the adventure playground. Our latest edition is child-sized tractors that you can drive around the grounds. We'll also be going into the farm that's part of the estate where there's plenty to do. Most of the buildings date from the 18th century, so you can really step back into an agricultural past. Still recently, the dairy was where milk from the cows was turned into cheese. It's now the place to go for lunch, or afternoon tea, or just a cup of coffee, and a slice of homemade cake. The big stone building that dominates the farm is the large barn, and in here is our collection of agricultural tools. These were used in the past to plow the earth, so seeds make gates and much more. There's a small barn, also made of stone, where you can groom the donkeys and horses to keep their coats clean. They really seem to enjoy having it done, and children love grooming them. The horses no longer live in the stables, which instead is the place to go to buy gifts, books, our own jams and pickles, and clothes and blankets made of wool from our sheep. Outside the shed, which is the only brick building, you can climb into a horse-drawn carriage for a lovely relaxing tour of the park and farm. The carriages are well over a hundred years old. And finally, the parkland, which was laid out in the 18th century, with a lake and trees that are now well established, you'll see types of cattle and sheep that are hardly ever found on farms these days, we're helping to preserve them, to stop their numbers falling further.

ielts-listening-0236-cam5-test-3-part-4.wav,"Well, my group has been doing a project on how household waste is recycled in Britain. We were quite shocked to discover that only 9% of people here in the UK make an effort to recycle their household waste. This is a lower figure than in most other European countries, and needs to increase dramatically in the next few years if the government is going to meet its recycling targets. The agreed targets for the UK mean that by 2008 we must reduce our carbon dioxide emissions by 12.5% compared with 1990. And recycling can help to achieve that goal in two main ways. The production of recycled glass and paper uses much less energy than producing them from virgin materials. And also recycling reduces greenhouse gas emissions from landfill sites and incineration plants. As part of our project we carried out a survey of people in the street, and the thing that came up over and over again is that people don't think it's easy enough to recycle their waste. One problem is that there aren't enough drop-off sites, that is the places where the public are supposed to take their waste. We also discovered that waste that's collected from householders is taken to places called bring banks for sorting and bailing into loads. One problem here is taking out everything that shouldn't have been placed in the recycling containers. People put all sorts of things into bottle banks like plastic bags and even broken umbrellas. All this has to be removed by hand. The difficulty is that toughened glass used for cooking doesn't fully melt at the temperature required for other glass, and so that also has to be picked out by hand. Glass is easy to recycle because it can be reused over and over again without becoming weaker. Two million tons of glass is thrown away each year, that is seven billion bottles and jars. But only 500,000 tons of that is collected and recycled. Oddly enough, half the glass that's collected is green, and a lot of that is imported, so more green glass is recycled than the UK needs. As a result, new uses are being developed for recycled glass, particularly green glass. For example, in fiberglass manufacture and water filtration. A company called CLF aggregates makes a product for roads, and 30% of the material is crushed glass. For recycling paper, Britain comes second in Europe with 40%, behind Germany's amazing 70%. When recycling started, there were quality problems, so it was difficult to use recycled paper in office printers, but these problems have now been solved. And Martins, based in South London, produces a range of office stationery which is 100% recycled. Costs the same as normal paper and is of equally high quality. But this high quality comes at a cost in terms of the waste produced during the process. Over a third of the waste paper that comes in can't be used in the recycled paper, leaving the question of what to do with it. One firm, paper-save, currently sells this to farmers, as a soil conditioner, though this practice will soon be banned because of transport costs and the smell, and the company is looking into the possibility of alternative uses. Plastic causes problems, because there are so many different types of plastic in use today, and each one has to be dealt with differently. Backright recycles all sorts of things, from bottles to car bumpers, and one of its most successful activities is recycling plastic bottles to make containers which are used all over the country to collect waste. The SAVE a CUP scheme was set up by the vending and plastics industries to recycle as many as possible of the three and a half billion polystyrene cups used each year. At the moment, 500 million poly cups are collected, processed, and sold on to other businesses such as Waterford, which turns the cups into pencils, and Johnson and Jones are Welch-based firm, which has developed a wide variety of items including business cards. Well, to sum up, there seems to be plenty of research going on into how to reuse materials, but the biggest problem is getting people to think about recycling instead of throwing things away. At least doing the research made us much more careful.",303.9101875,142.14725855479918,Ideal
short-stories-0275-278-the-calgary-stampede.wav,"The Calgary Stampede The Wild West, as we know it from Hollywood Westerns, did not last a long time. Its height was from about 1865 to 1885, for only 20 years. By 1885, there were railways across the plains. Fences had been built around farms and ranches and lawnmowers around the lookout for any troublemakers. Not only that, but by 1885, nearly all the buffalo had been killed and most of the Indians were on reservations. Still, the Wild West had captured the imagination of the reading public. A former Buffalo hunter and Indian scout, Buffalo Bill Cody, decided to take advantage of his fame as a cowboy. In 1883, he organized Buffalo Bill's Wild West show, in tour North America and Europe. Alberta, Canada had been the last part of the Old West to be settled, but by 1912, ranching was being replaced by farming. The city of Calgary was itself becoming a commercial and industrial center. Old-timers looked back fondly to the old days of cowboys and Indians. In 1908, the Miller Brothers Wild West show visited Calgary. One of the cowboys, Guy Weedick, talked to local businessmen about putting on a rodeo and the Wild West show. Eventually, four Calgary businessmen put up $25,000 each to finance the event. Weedick was a good organizer. He advertised all over the US and the Canadian West for cowboys and rodeo riders to come. Starting with $25,000 in prize money, people came from as far away as Mexico. Weedick was able to persuade the Canadian government to let large numbers of Indians leave their reservations to attend. In fact, the Indians were a big part of the program. The main rodeo events were Bronco riding, Bearback riding, Women's Bronco riding, Steer Roping and Bulldogging. These events were based on things that working cowboys actually did, but to make them harder, special bucking horses were brought in. And horse names Cyclone had never been written long by anyone. He had thrown 127 riders in a row. Most of the rodeo cowboys came from the United States, from Wyoming, Oregon, Oklahoma, Colorado, and Arizona. But there were also Canadian cowboys and some Canadian Indians competing. Queen Victoria's son, the Duke of Cannot, was the Grand Marshal. Many cowboys rode well and but no one could stay on Cyclone. On the sixth and final day, the grounds were muddy from rain and the horses kept slipping. In escape from his handlers and ran around the track. For his last Bronco riding contest, Cyclone's rider would be Tom Three Persons. Three Persons was a blood Indian from southern Alberta. When three Persons got on Cyclone, the horse would rear up and plunge its head down to throw the rider. Cyclone acted as though it would topple over backwards, but three Persons hung on. Then it hurled itself forward, with its head almost touching the ground. After a wild ride of several minutes, Cyclone began to tire. The judges declared Tom Three Persons the winner of the Bucking Bronco event. Three Persons was the only Canadian to win a major event at that first Calgary Stampede in 1912. Today the Calgary Stampede continues to be the largest rodeo and wild west show in North America. It has many new events and attractions and still attracts the best rodeo riders from all over North America.",197.8253125,169.54352087779463,Fast
ielts-listening-0272-cam3-test-4-part-4.wav,"Good afternoon. I'm Paula Bundle, and I am giving you the lectures on environmental noise this term. Today we're going to look into the effects of noise on a planned housing estate in a particularly difficult part of the new Manchester Park area. This site is not as bad as some I have researched in the past. The Black Tarn airport is closed from 6pm to 7am, and this is a great advantage to the site. The only noise after dark is from the highway, and the traffic is somewhat reduced between 7.30pm and 5.30am. So the people most affected by the noise will be, I expect, housewives. By the time most of the students and workers have arrived back home in the evening during the week, the noise will have abated to a fairly large extent. The weekends are still a problem of course, but the traffic is certainly reduced on Saturdays to a large extent, and even more so on Sundays. Of course, modifications to houses will be necessary at a site like this, and they come at a significant cost to the developer and home buyer. The modifications I'm about to outline will add about $25,000 to the price of a newly built house. That will still mean a cheaper house than in a less noisy and more desirable area. A bit of background would not go astray, I understand that you are all familiar with the proposed development site at Manchester Park. It's a particularly difficult one in terms of noise, with the highway along the eastern perimeter, and the Blacktown airport not 3km away to the north. Of course, those nearest the highway will be the worst hit, with heavy traffic noise as well as the noise from the light planes overhead. As you all know, the normal noise threshold for private housing is 55 decibels. At this site, the levels have been recorded as high as 67 decibels. The construction of the houses has to be somewhat modified from houses in most areas. In the houses on the highway and in the noisiest areas of this site, there will be a need for specialised double blazing, and special acoustic seals will have to be fitted to the doors. All exterior doors in this especially noisy pocket will have to be solid core wood doors with hinges. Every house built on this site, not just those adjacent to the highway or nearest to the airport, will require high density insulation materials in the roof. Not only will all the roofs need insulating, the exterior walls will be required to be double brick. All ceilings will require double thickness plasterboard to be used in the construction. In the noisiest areas, mechanical ventilation will have to be installed in the exterior walls. In those areas with sealed windows, it will be necessary to fit fans with absorbers to cut out the noise in those particular houses. Air conditioning units could also be fitted in the ceilings of such houses, but this is substantially more expensive than fans and may not be needed on this site. Coming back now to the double glazing I mentioned before, specialised double glazing requires a larger air gap between the inner and outer glass than normal double glazing. The gap must be at least 7 cm. The thickness of the glass is also a factor, 8 mm on the outside and 6 on the inside pane. It's essential that the glass be thicker on the outside than on the inside, and that the gap between the panes of glass be a minimum of 7 cm. Obviously, the noise factor will have to be taken into consideration with the layout of the houses. Living areas will have to be designed at the back of the houses away from the highway. Beardrooms and living rooms will have to be built towards the back. And for those houses closest to the highway, two layers of plasterboard will be needed for the interior bedroom walls. Those rooms constructed at the front of the houses should be garages, laundry, kitchens, bathrooms and dining rooms. I have come to the conclusion that this development should go ahead, but with various acoustic modifications according to the position of the block in relation to the highway and intersection.",292.313375,147.37608226103237,Ideal

ielts-listening-0176-cam9-test-4-part-4.wav,"Good morning. Today I'd like to present the findings of our year two project on Wildlife found in gardens throughout our city. I'll start by saying something about the background to the project, then talk a little bit about our research techniques, and then indicate some of our interim findings. First of all, how did we choose our topic? Well, there are four of us in the group and one day, while we were discussing a possible focus, two of the group mentioned that they had seen yet more sparrow hawks, one of Britain's most interesting birds of prey, in their own city-center gardens, and wondered why they were turning up in these gardens in great numbers. We were all very engaged by the idea of why wild animals would choose to inhabit a city garden. Why is it so popular with wildlife when the countryside itself is becoming less so? The first thing we did was to establish what proportion of the urban land is taken up by private gardens. We estimated that it was about one-fifth, and this was endorsed by looking at large-scale usage maps in the town land survey office, 24% to be precise. Our own informal discussions with neighbors and friends led us to believe that many garden owners had interesting experiences to relate regarding wild animal sightings, so we decided to survey garden owners from different areas of the city. Just over 100 of them completed a survey once every two weeks for 12 months, ticking off species they had seen from a pro-formalist, and adding the names of any rarer ones, meanwhile we were doing our own observations in selected gardens throughout the city. We deliberately chose smaller ones because they were by far the most typical in the city. The whole point of the project was to look at the norm, not the exception. Alongside this primary research on urban gardens, we were studying a lot of books about the decline of wild animals in the countryside and thinking of possible causes for this. So what did we find? Well, so much that I just won't have time to tell you about here. If you're interested in reading our more comprehensive findings, we've produced detailed graphic representations on the college website, and of course any of the group would be happy to talk to you about them. Just email us. What we've decided to present today is information about just three species because we felt these gave a good indication of the processes at work in rural and urban settings as a whole. The first species to generate a lot of interesting information was frogs, and there was a clear pattern here. They proliferate where there is suitable water. Garden ponds are on the increase, rural ponds are disappearing, leading to massive migration to the towns. Hedgehogs are also finding it easier to live in urban areas, this time because their predators are not finding it quite so attractive to leave their rural environment. So hedgehogs have a better survival rate in cities. We had lots of sightings, so all in all we had no difficulties with our efforts to count their numbers precisely. Our final species is the finest of bird singers, the song thrush. On the decline in the countryside, they are experiencing a resurgence in urban gardens because these days gardeners are buying lots of different plants, which means there's an extensive range of seeds around, which is what they feed on. Another factor is the provision of nesting places, which is actually better in gardens than the countryside. Hard to believe it, but it's true. Incidentally, we discovered that a massive new survey on song thrushes is about to be launched, so you should keep an eye open for that. Now I'd be happy to answer any questions you may have.",227.2644375,169.75819193005066,Fast

short-stories-0248-251-harriet-tubman.wav,"Harriet Tubman Before the American Civil War, the economy of the southern states was based on the use of slave labor. The social and political leaders of the old south were the plantation owners. Many of these own hundreds of black slaves. The slaves were mainly used to pick crops like cotton and tobacco. Harriet Tubman was born in 1820 in the state of Maryland. As a girl of seven, she was sent into the fields to work with the adult slaves. The slaves worked from sunrise to sunset, picking the crops. Often they sang songs while they worked. Slaves were not taught to read or write. It was fear that reading and writing would help slaves to escape the plantations. Harriet Tubman was a literate. Later in life, when she was in danger of being captured, she picked up a book and pretended to read it. This fooled the bounty hunters. When she was fifteen, Harriet helped another slave to escape. The overseer was so angry with her that he hit her over the head with an iron weight. Harriet was not unconscious for many days. All the rest of her life she suffered from headaches and sudden sleeping spells. Harriet escaped from the plantation to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. As Pennsylvania was not a slave state, Harriet was fairly safe there. She was able to return secretly to the plantation and bring the rest of her family to freedom. There were already people working to bring black slaves up from the south to freedom. These people, both white and black, used the language of the railroad. Escape slaves were called passengers. Safe houses were called stations. And the guides were called conductors. But soon became a conductor in the Underground Railway. In 1850, the American government passed a second fugitive slave act. This put more pressure on northern states to return escape slaves to the south. Because of this, the Underground Railway went further north to Canada. In 1793, Upper Canada, Ontario, had passed a law bringing a gradual stop to slavery. In 1834, slavery was abolished in the whole British Empire. A lot of escape slaves had come to Canada before 1850, but now nearly all escape slaves tried to go there. Harriet Tubman rented a house in St. Catherine's Ontario. This provided a shelter for new arrivals. Harriet made about 11 trips from Canada to the US during these years. In all, she brought back about 300 people. The escape slaves had to travel by night and suffered hardships in bad weather. They had to hide during the day wherever they could. Harriet did not allow any passengers to turn back. That might endanger the whole Underground Railway. When the slave owners heard about Harriet, they offered a reward for her capture, but no one caught her or turned her in. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, she acted as a spy for the northern states. After the war, she married a black American soldier, Nelson Davis. In 1869, a book was written about Harriet Tubman. Black slaves knew Harriet as Moses. The Bible tells this story of how Moses led the people of Israel out of slavery in Egypt. He led them north to Palestine. In the same way, Harriet Tubman delivered many of her people from slavery and led them north to freedom.",230.66125,145.40803884484282,Ideal

ielts-listening-0062-cam16-test-4-part-2.wav,"But we now have the results of the survey carried out last month about traffic and road transport in the town. People were generally satisfied with the state of the roads. There were one or two complaints about potholes, which will be addressed, but a significant number of people complained about the increasing number of heavy vehicles using our local roads to avoid traffic elsewhere. We'd expected more complaints by commuters about the reduction in the train service, but it doesn't seem to have affected people too much. The cycle path that runs alongside the river is very well used by both cyclists and pedestrians since the surface was improved last year, but overtaking can be a problem, so we're going to add a bit on the side to make it wider. At some stage we'd like to extend the path so that it goes all the way through the town, but that won't be happening in the immediate future. The plans to have a pedestrian crossing next to the post office have unfortunately had to be put on hold for the time being. We'd budgeted for this to be done this financial year, but then there were rumours that the post office was going to move, which would have meant there wasn't really a need for a crossing. Now they've confirmed that they're staying where they are, but the highways department have told us that it would be dangerous to have a pedestrian crossing where we'd originally planned it as they'd subbend in the road there, so that'll need some more thought. On station road near the station and level crossing, drivers can face quite long waits if the level crossing's closed, and we've now got signs up requesting them not to leave their engines running at that time. This means pedestrians waiting on the pavement to cross the railway line don't have to breathe in car fumes. We've had some problems with cyclists leaving their bikes chain to the railings outside the ticket office, but the station has agreed to provide bike racks there. So next on the agenda is proposals for improvements to the recreation ground. Councillor Thornton again. Well, since we managed to extend the recreation ground, we've spent some time talking to local people about how it could be made a more attractive and useful space. If you have a look at the map up on the screen, you can see the river up in the north and the community hall near the entrance from the road. At present, cars can park between the community hall and that line of trees to the east, but this is quite dangerous for pedestrians, so we're suggesting a new car park on the opposite side of the community hall right next to it. We also have a new location for the cricket pitch. As we've now purchased additional space to the east of the recreation ground beyond the trees, we plan to move it away from its current location, which is rather near the road into this new area beyond the line of trees. This means there's less danger of stray balls hitting cars or pedestrians. We've got plans for a children's playground, which will be accessible by a footpath from the community hall and will be alongside the river. We'd originally thought of having it close to the road, but we think this will be a more attractive location. The skateboard ramp is very popular with both younger and older children. We had considered moving this up towards the river, but in the end we decided to have it in the southeast corner near the road. The pavilion is very well used at present by both football players and cricketers. It will stay where it is now to the left of the line of trees and near to the river, handy for both the football and cricket pitches. And finally we'll be getting a new notice board for local information, and that will be directly on people's right as they go from the road into the recreation ground.",240.81275,169.67540132322728,Fast

Her classes seemed to go by really fast and the day went by even faster. When Natalie got home, she was so excited. She told her mom that classes weren't all that scary. The students and the teachers weren't scary either. Natalie knew that the schoolwork would be hard, but she felt good about the people she had met that day. She knew she'd have a good year.",117.91675,150.105900985229,Fast

short-stories-0177-178-kings-and-queens-of-england.wav,"Kings and Queens of England. Today, in the early 21st century, most countries no longer have kings and queens. However, some countries have remained as monarchies, including England and its former colonies. However, even in these countries, the monarch is a ceremonial figure who no longer has any real power over his or her subjects. These countries are called constitutional monarchies because they are democracies in which the monarch remains the official head of state. Many years ago, the kings and queens of England did have real power, but, gradually, this power was transferred to the people and their elected officials. It is interesting to examine how this transition occurred. Even in very early times, the king of England did not have absolute power. He was the most powerful man in the country, but he could not entirely force his will upon others. If he became too demanding, he might face opposition from powerful local landowners. These men, called the barons, might resist a king who tried to become too strong. This is exactly what happened in the year 1215. The king of England had made many unreasonable demands upon the country and the barons decided to resist. They forced the king to agree to a list of rules that would limit his power. These rules were written in a famous document called the Magna Carta. This document described not only the rights of the barons, but also of the common people of England. During the next few hundred years, the kings still had much power. However, some other people, such as the landowners and the richer men of the towns, also had influence. Their meetings became known as parliaments, and the king had to share power with the parliament. During the 1640s, one king tried to rule without parliament and tried to take away the rights of parliament. This led to a civil war, and the king was defeated. England soon became a monarchy again, but it became clear that parliament would have more power than the king. Until the 20th century, the parliaments of England became more democratic, as more and more people were allowed to vote. Today, England still has a constitutional monarchy, but not all English-speaking countries recognize the English queen. For example, the United States became an independent country over 200 years ago and has become a republic ever since. In some countries, there is a debate about the future of the monarchy. Canada, Australia, and New Zealand still recognize the queen of England as their own queen, even though those countries are no longer governed by England. Many people in those countries want to abolish the monarchy. They believe that their countries should now have their own head of state. On the other hand, some people in those countries want to keep the monarchy because it reminds them of their country's early history. This is an ongoing topic of debate for Canadians, Australians, and New Zealanders.",208.0130625,141.91416464530926,Ideal

short-stories-0225-227-louisa-may-alcott.wav,"Luisa May Alcott New England in the early and middle years of the 19th century had a flourishing culture. People were passionately interested in ideas and education. Most New Englanders were strongly opposed to slavery. They were also concerned about other social issues. New ideas resulted in new kinds of writing. These ideas included the importance of doing what seemed right for them, no matter how different it was from what other people thought. People also believed that nature gave them guidance in our lives and that it was important to live close to nature. These and other ideas were expressed through teaching and writing. Bronson Alcott was one of those who looked at the world in a new way. He looked for work as a teacher so that he could pass on his ideas to others. However, very few parents wanted Mr. Alcott to teach their children, and very few people were interested in hearing his speeches or reading his books. As a result, the Alcott family was very poor. Fortunately for Bronson, he married a very capable and energetic woman. Mrs. Abigail Alcott helped earn money to support the family and did most of the work involved in looking after the four Alcott girls. The oldest daughter Anna was quiet and serious. She rarely got into trouble and was a good helper at home. The second daughter was Luisa May Alcott, who became a writer. She was adventurous and cared very little for rules. She was always saying and doing things that got her into trouble. The third daughter Elizabeth was very kind and good-natured. All the others loved her. As a young woman, Elizabeth had a severe case of scarlet fever and never fully recovered. She died at age 23. The youngest sister May was talented, but she was rather spoiled. Because there was never enough money, the Alcott girls felt pressure to work at an early age, but this did not stop them from having fun. Luisa wrote little plays that she and her sisters performed at home. They all enjoyed the woods and ponds around Concord, Massachusetts, where they lived most of these years. When they moved back to Boston in 1848, Anna took a job looking after other people's children, and Luisa looked after the house. Meanwhile, their mother worked outside the home. While working on laundry or sewing, Luisa was thinking up stories. At night she would write them down. When she was 18, she began selling poems and stories to magazines. With in ten years, Luisa was earning a substantial income from writing. One day, her publisher suggested that she write a story for girls. At first, Luisa didn't like the suggestion, but when she started to write, the ideas came rapidly. Her book was based on her own family and her own childhood. Little Women was published in 1868 and was an immediate success. The March family was very much like the Alcats. Mrs. Alcott resembles Marmy. Meg is like Anna, and Joe is like Luisa herself. Beth is based on Elizabeth, and Amy on May Alcott. Many of the situations in the book happened to the Alcott family. Nonetheless, many characters and incidents were invented. Little Women and its sequel opened up a new kind of writing for children. While these books did have a moral, they were more lively and interesting than earlier children's writing. Little Women inspired many writers later to write more realistic accounts of childhood.",230.2694375,150.8667427912573,Fast
ielts-listening-0328-ielts-recent-actual-test-34-part-4.wav,"Good morning! Today we will continue our study of crocodilists naloticus by talking about its living habits. We've already discussed the evolutionary attributes that set it apart from its crocodile relatives. Does everyone remember that? Yes, it has an extremely narrow snout and three or four rows of protective scales on its back, as compared to two rows on other members of the crocodilist genus. Let's take a look at how these carnivorous manitas live, where they live, and finally whether they really deserve their vicious reputation. To start, I'd like to address a great question posed to me by a student during yesterday's office hours. We talked about the distribution of crocodiles in Africa and saw that they are highly concentrated in the south and west of the continent. This student noticed that on the map displaying the distribution of crocodiles across Africa, there were no crocodiles in the northern region, and found no mention in the literature of the existence of crocodiles in the north of Africa. Why might there be no crocodiles in North Africa? Let's save this question for later in the lecture. To find out more about the social habits of the African crocodile, one researcher named Tara Shine of the University of Ulster in Northern Ireland conducted a survey of the wetlands in Mauritania, and received reports of 46 crocodiles living in one group, or float as we say when referring to crocodiles, though the usual number is a little less than half of that. In general, crocodiles are more highly concentrated in wet, subtropical environments near bodies of water and rich vegetation. While South American crocodiles thrive in cool rain forests, the African crocodile is more equipped for heat. Though they can survive at the hot temperatures found in some deserts, they are not equipped to handle dry climates, and thus cannot survive in places like the Sahara Desert of North Africa. As cold-blooded animals, crocodiles core temperatures fluctuate from their average of 38 degrees Celsius as external conditions change. Thus they need to avoid extreme temperatures. Others live an underwater life, keeping a body temperature close to that of the water. As their own unique method of regulating their body temperatures, some African crocodiles have made dens by digging holes in the ground to provide themselves with a cool dark place to retreat from the hot African sun. Speaking of the hot African sun, let's go back to the question asked at the beginning of the lecture. We know that they used to be crocodiles in Northern Africa, yet today there are none. What are some possible explanations for this? Some students have suggested that the African crocodile has evolved from a desert creature into a wetland creature, thus causing them to migrate south for more appropriate conditions. Others presume that the crocodile was hunted out of Northern Africa by a fierce predator. While these are intelligent guesses, the real story is a little bit different. The key to this migration is that the Sahara Desert did not always cover the north of Africa. About 8,000 years ago the land was fertile wetlands, perfect for breeding crocodiles. Over time though, the area dried out and the wetland slowly turned to desert, leading the African crocodile to migrate south to the marshlands they call home today. Some crocodiles did however adapt to living in dry conditions. In Mauritania, some crocodiles have learned to survive in an area where they can go up to 8 months with no water, by spending the driest of times in what's called the torpor or short period of hibernation. To utilise every bit of rainfall, these desert crocodiles dig underground caves that collect runoff, thus staying cool and hydrated. During the mating period in November and December, the females attract females to their viciously protected territory through a number of behaviours that range from snapping their jaws all the way to sending infrasonic pulses through the water. Afterwards, the female digs a hole up to 60cm in depth to store the eggs for an 80 day incubation period. The female protects these eggs during the period and sometimes even helps crack the eggs with her snout at the end. These teeth gnashing carnivores are softer than we think. Although these vicious creatures have attacked humans on a few occasions, the residents are not afraid of them. In fact, they show a great deal of reverence towards these wondrous creatures. Some say that crocodiles bring water to their habitat, so if they leave, they will bring the water with them. Obviously this is not true, but it demonstrates the admiration the inhabiting people have for crocodiles. Generally, crocodiles do not predate on humans. They attack when humans populate the crocodiles habitat, instilling fear and uneasiness in the crocs. Like any other species, crocodiles are known to attack when feeling fear. There's still a lot more to be discovered about the African crocodile. Researchers want to know more about the population size, how many crocodiles in Habitatfrika in all, how they form separate floats, etc. There is still also much to learn about migration patterns and relations to other populations of crocodiles now found in other parts of the world. Next time, we'll examine a few specific case studies of crocodile populations in Sub and Africa.",365.2025,145.56307801835968,Ideal
ielts-listening-0322-ielts-recent-actual-test-33-part-2.wav,"Hi folks, my name is Loretta Johnston, and I am here from the Baltimore Department of Public Waste. Thank you for coming out to our community meeting tonight. I've got a few words to say about the Waste Collection here in Baltimore. First, there's the sorted collection bins themselves. They're made of sturdy solid material, so none of your trash can seep out or puncture the bin. Also, since these things sit out on the curb overnight, rain or shine, they have to be waterproof. We can't have water getting up in it and filling up the bin. Remember to pay attention to which bin is which, and sort your waste accordingly. You should have a blue or green bin for recyclable garbage, a yellow bin for unrecyclable garbage, and a red bin for toxic waste. Our city-wide waste management is divided into two services. The first is commercial waste collection, or trash collection from buildings. The majority of building waste is paper, which goes in the blue or green bins. You'll notice in your office buildings there are signs that warn you not to overfill these bins. All that paper adds up, and an overflowing bin is infinitely harder for collectors to carry to the truck and empty. Aside from paper, another large source of building waste is metals. Metal, such as tin and aluminium, can be put in the yellow recycle bins, but metals like lead and copper should be disposed of in the red bins. These heavy metals are harmful to the environment and exacerbate our city's existing pollution problem. That's about all the information you need for building waste. Moving on to the second service, House All Waste Collection is probably what you primarily think of when you think of what we do here. Many of the same guidelines apply, the sorting is the same, etc. Please remember to keep garbage like kitchen waste in a plastic bag. It makes collection easier and lessens the abominable rotten trash smell. So after we take your trash away, what happens to it? We take all the garbage to one of a number of garbage disposal plants, each of which is located in the middle of an open space of some sort. No one wants to have their home or office right next door to a waste disposal plant, right? Waste is collected and then disposed of once every four weeks. A lot of trash can build up in that time, so we're in the process of developing a plan to fund collection more frequently. Ideally it would be collected weekly, but we will likely have to settle for bi-weekly. The garbage trucks make their rounds to clear the bins at night in order to avoid traffic. I'm sure you've seen how much waste your own household produces in a given week. Now imagine all the trash produced by all the households in Baltimore. It's a lot right? It may surprise you that this amount is only marginal compared to commercial waste. Yep, the main waste producers are actually businesses, industrial facilities, retail and offices. Hard to believe humans produce that much waste, right? No wonder we have pollution problems. Anyway, after all incoming waste is sorted, recyclables are sent to a recycling plant, while garbage and toxic waste are transported to their respective areas of the plant for treatment. Items such as stones, which should not be disposed of in our bins, are separated out and discarded. Once the trash has undergone the treatment process, it is compacted and disposed of with all the other trash. And finally, when the landfill space is full, it is buried deep underground, and in time something new is built on the land. That's everything about waste collection. Thank you for listening. Are there any questions?",235.019875,161.85865131619187,Fast

ielts-listening-0264-cam3-test-2-part-4.wav,"Thanks. Mr. Yardley has asked me to describe to you the project I did as a student teacher at a secondary school in London. I was at this school for six weeks and I taught a variety of subjects to a class of fourteen-year-old pupils. The project I chose to do was a hat-making project and I think this project could easily be adapted to suit any age. So to explain the project. After we'd done the research, we went back to the classroom to make two basic hat shapes using rolls of old wallpaper. We each made, first of all, a conical hat by, um, well, if I show you now, cutting out a circle and then making one cut up to the centre and then, um, overlapping the cut like this. A conical hat that sits on your head. The other hat we made was a little more complicated. Um, first of all, we cut out a circle again like this. Then you need a long piece with flaps on it. I've already made that bit, which I have here. You bend the flaps over and stick them with glue or pricked stick to the underside of the circle. Like this. Again, I've prepared this so that I don't get glue everywhere. The pupils do, of course, so you need plenty of covers for the table. And there you have a pillbox hat as in pill and box. Now, variations and combinations of these two hat shapes form the basis of the pupil's final designs. The next stage of the project was the design phase, and this involved, first of all, using their pages of research to draw a design of their hat on paper. That's the easy part. They then had to translate their two-dimensional design into a form to fit their head. I encouraged them to make a small scale three-dimensional hat first, so that they could experiment with how to achieve the form they required. And I imposed certain constraints on them to keep things simple. For example, they had to use paper, not card. Paper is more pliable and easier to handle. They also had to limit their colors to white, gray, or brown shades of paper, which reflected the colors of the buildings they were using as a model for their hats. And they had to make sure their glue didn't show. Well, it was very enjoyable. And just to give you an idea of what they produced, I brought along three hats to show you. This one here is based on a circular stairway in an old building in London. It uses three pillbox hats, one on top of the other. This was designed by Theresa. Here's another one that has a simple strip going round the base of the hat, but has then gone on to add strips of paper that come out from the base and that meet at the top of the hat, rather like a crown, making a fairly tall hat. This was made by Muriel. And lastly, there's a combination of the pillbox or single strip around the base and then the conical hat shape on top to form a castle turret. This was made by Frebris. And there are many more that I could have brought.",220.91325,149.37990364996213,Ideal

I understand it's your first visit here, so I'd like to give you some background information about the Museum and then explain a little about what you can see during your visit. So, where we're standing at the moment is the entrance to a large building that was constructed in 1880 as the home of a local businessman Alfred Palmer of the Palmer Biscuit factory. It was later sold and became a hall of residence for students in 1911 and a museum in 1951. In 2005 a modern extension was built to accommodate the museum's collections. The museums owned by the university and apart from two rooms that are our offices, the university uses the main part of the building. You may see students going into the building for lessons but it's not open to museum visitors I'm afraid. It's a shame because the interior architectural features are outstanding, especially the room that used to be the library. Luckily we've managed to keep entry to the museum free. This includes access to all the galleries, outdoor areas and the rooms for special exhibitions. We run activities for children and students such as the museum club for which there is no charge. We do have a donation box just over there so feel free to give whatever amount you consider appropriate. We do have a cloakroom if you'd like to leave your coats and bags somewhere. Unlike other museums photography is allowed here so you might like to keep your cameras with you. You might be more comfortable not carrying around heavy rocksacks, though keep your coats and jackets on as it's quite cold in the museum garden today. I'd like to tell you about the different areas of the museum. Just inside and outside the main gallery we have an area called Four Seasons. Here you can watch a four minute animation of a woodland scene. It was designed especially for the museum by a group of young people on a film studies course and it's beautiful. Children absolutely love it but then so do adults. The main galleries called Town and Country. It includes a photographic collection of prize-winning sheep and shepherds. Leaving Town and Country you enter Farmhouse Kitchen which is well self-explanatory. Here we have the oldest collection of equipment for making butter and cheese in the country. And this morning a specialist cheese maker will be giving demonstrations of how it's produced. You may even get to dry some. After that you can go in two directions. To the right is a staircase that takes you up to a landing from where you can look down on the galleries. To the left is a room called A Year on the Farm. There is lots of seating here as sometimes we use the room for school visits so it's a good place to stop for a rest. If you're feeling competitive you can take our memory test in which you answer questions about things you've seen in the museum. The next area is called Wagonwalk. This contains farm carts from nearly every part of the country. It's surprising how much regional variation there was. Beside the carts are display boards with information about each one. The carts are old and fragile so we ask you to keep your children close to you and ensure they don't climb on the carts. From Wagonwalk you can either make your way back to reception or go out into the garden or even go back to take another look in the galleries. In the far corner of the garden is Bes our magic but we're redeveloping this area so you can't visit that at the moment. You can still buy our honey in the shop though. Finally there's the pond which contains all kinds of interesting wildlife. There are baby ducks that are only a few days old as well as tiny frogs. The pond isn't deep and there is a fence around it so it's perfectly safe for children.",301.9110625,135.1391355525437,Ideal

What was even more interesting was that if the photos were shown in quick succession, the horse looked like it was running. In other words, moving pictures. The person who became interested in taking the moving pictures to its next step was the famous American inventor Thomas Edison. Actually, he didn't do the work himself, but rather asked a young Scotsman and his employee to design a system, which he did. Now this young fellow was clever because the first thing he did was study other systems primitive as they were of moving pictures and then put all the existing technologies together to make the first entire motion picture system. He designed a camera, a projection device, and the film. The system was first shown in New York in 1894 and was really very popular. Apparently people lined up around the block to see the wonderful new invention. There were, however, a couple of problems with the system. The camera weighed over 200 kilograms and only one person at a time could see the film. Well now. News of the new system in America traveled fast and a number of rival European systems started to appear once people had heard about it. The single problem with all the systems was they couldn't really project the film onto a screen. You know, so more than one person could see it. Then in 1895, three systems were all developed, more or less at the same time and independently of each other. I guess the most famous of these was by the Lumière brothers from France and they called their system the Cinematograph, which of course is where the word Cinema comes from. There were also two brothers in Germany who developed a successful system and they called it a bioscope. Well, now once the problem of projection had been solved, the next challenge for the inventors was to make the films longer and more interesting. A continuing problem at the time was that the films had a tendency to break when they were being played. A problem which was caused by the tension between the two wheels or reels as they are called, which hold the film. Now this problem was solved by two American brothers. They developed the Lampham Loop, which was the simple addition of a third reel between the two main reels. And this took all the tension away with the result that the film stopped snapping. So now there was a real possibility of having films of more than two or three minutes. And this led to the making of the great train robbery, the very first movie made. It only lasted eleven minutes, but was an absolute sensation. And there were cases of people watching the movie and actually fainting when the character fired a gun at the camera. Almost overnight movies became a craze. And by 1905, people in America were lining up to see movies in store theaters as they were called then. I guess the next big step in terms of development of technology was to have people actually talking on the film. And the first step towards this was in 1926 when sound effects were first used on a film. It wasn't until the following year, however, that the first talky as they were called then was made. This film featured actors speaking only during parts of the film and was called the Jazz Singer. And it wasn't until 1928 that the first all-talking film was produced, and this was called The Lights of New York. Unfortunately, the sound on this early film was not very good, and I believe they put subtitles on the film. That is, they printed the dialogue along the bottom of the film to compensate for this poor sound quality. Now, with the addition of sound, moving pictures became far more difficult to make.",291.173875,147.1285842522788,Ideal

So, let me tell you a bit about what's on offer. I'll start by telling you about some of the excursions that are available for guests. One thing you have to do while you're here is go Dolphin watching. On our boat trips, we pretty well guarantee you'll see Dolphins. If you don't, you can repeat the trip free of charge. We organise daily trips for just 35 euros. Unfortunately, there aren't any places left for the Saftoun's trip, but come and see me to book for later in the week. If you're energetic, I'd recommend our Forest Walk. It's a guided walk of about 7 kilometers. There'll be a stop halfway, and you'll be provided with a drink and sandwiches. There's some fairly steep climbs up the hills, so you need to be reasonably fit for this one, with good shoes, and bring a waterproof in case it rains. It's just 25 euros, all inclusive, and it's every Wednesday. Then on Thursdays, we organise a cycle trip, which will give you all the fun of biking without the effort. We'll take you and your bike up to the top of Mount Lana, and leave you to bike back. It's a 700 metre drop in just 20 kilometres, so this isn't really for inexperienced cyclists, as you'll be going pretty fast. And if it's a clear day, you'll have fantastic views. On our local craft tour, you can find out about the traditional activities in the island, the best thing about this trip is that it's completely free. You'll be taken to a factory where jewelry is made, and also a ceramic centre. If you want, you can buy some of the products, but that's entirely up to you. The trip starts after lunch on Thursday, and you'll return by 6pm. If you're interested in astronomy, you may already know that the islands, one of the best places in the world to observe the night sky. We can offer trips to the observatory on Friday, for those who are interested. They cost 90 euros per person, and you'll be shown the huge telescopes and have a talk from an expert who will explain all about how they work. Afterwards, we'll head down to Sunset Beach, where you can have a dip in the ocean if you want, before we head off back to the hotel. Finally, there's horse riding. This is organised by the Equestrian Centre over near Plyor Cortino, and it's a great experience if you're a keen horseback rider, or even if you've never been on a horse before. They take you down to the beach, and you can canter along the sand and through the waves. It costs 35 euros, and it's available every day. So, there's plenty to do in the daytime, but what about nightlife? Well, the number one attraction is called Musical Favorites. Guests enjoy a three-course meal and unlimited free drinks, and watch a fantastic show, starting with musical set in Paris, and then crossing the Atlantic to Las Vegas, and finally Copacabana. At the end, the cast members come down from the stage, still in their stunning costumes, and you'll have a chance to chat with them. It's hugely popular, so let me know now if you're interested, because it's no good leaving it until the last minute. It's on Friday night. Tickets suggest 50 euros each, but for an extra 10 euros, you can have a table right by the stage. If you'd like to go back in time, there's the castle feast on Saturday evening. It's held in a 12th century castle, and you eat in the great courtyard, with ladies in long gowns serving your food. You're given a whole chicken each, which you eat in the medieval way, using your hands instead of cutlery, and you're entertained by competitions, where the horseback riders attempt to not one another off their horses.

He invented hundreds of products that could be made from crops such as peanuts and sweet potatoes, and he changed the methods of farming in the southern United States. The story of George Washington Carver's life is interesting and inspiring, as it shows how some people can achieve success despite adversity. George Washington Carver was born in a small town in the American state of Missouri in 1864 or 1865. He was named after the first president of the United States. George's parents were slaves. His father was killed in an accident, and his mother was kidnapped and later died. George and his brother were raised by a married couple, the Carvers, who had owned George's mother. George was often sick during his childhood, but he showed an intense interest in nature. The Carvers taught George to read and write, and he became known locally as an expert on plants. Later, the Carvers sent George to a school for African American children in a nearby town. After his graduation, George Washington Carver continued his education in the state of Iowa. While a student in Iowa, Carver had very little money and had to work at many jobs to afford the costs of his education. However, his knowledge of plants was very impressive, and after receiving his master's degree, he became a teacher at the college he had attended as a student. Soon, however, Carver moved south to the state of Alabama, where he worked as a teacher and researcher at a college for African American students. It was here that Carver stayed for the rest of his life, and it was here that he performed his important agricultural research. One problem for farmers in the Southern United States was that the most widespread crops, cotton and tobacco, tended to remove nutrients from the soil. Carver realized that this problem could be solved to some extent by rotating the cotton and tobacco crops with other kinds of crops, such as peanuts and sweet potatoes, which could help to preserve the nutrients in the soil. Carver's discoveries made the peanut, the sweet potato, and the soybean very useful to Southern farmers. He invented the food product known as peanut butter, plus hundreds of other products. For example, Carver found ways to produce plastics, ink, cooking oil, paints, and cosmetics from peanuts and other crops. Carver also developed a new variety of cotton. Carver received many awards for his scientific research, but he was never interested in fame or fortune. When Carver died in 1943, the American government made his birthplace a national monument. Today, Carver is still known as a great agricultural scientist.",188.708625,145.30337444830622,Ideal

The story is very remarkable and inspiring because the teaching was done without sight and without sound. Helen Keller was born in the American state of Alabama in 1880. She was a happy and healthy baby, but before she reached the age of two, she was struck by a severe fever. As a result of this fever, she became both deaf and blind. After her illness, the young Helen Keller learned to use her other senses. For example, she touched other people's hands to figure out what they were doing, and this way she also learned that people could communicate by moving their lips. Helen could not talk, instead she communicated with her family by making sign movements with her hands and body. However, Helen became very frustrated by her inability to see, hear, and talk. Helen Keller often became very angry and had many temper tantrums. When Helen Keller was six years old, her family took her to see Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, who was an expert on educating deaf children. This man was also famous for inventing the telephone. As a result of this visit, Helen's parents hired a tutor for their daughter. The tutor was a very intelligent deaf woman, named Anne Sullivan. At first it was difficult to teach Helen because she still made many angry outbursts. Gradually, Anne Sullivan gained Helen's trust. One day Anne began to teach Helen to communicate, and took Helen to a well and pumped some water onto Helen's hand. Then Anne used her finger to write the letters W-A-T-E-R onto Helen's hand. By repeating this, Anne was able to teach Helen how to write the word water. As soon as Helen learned that things could be named in this way, she wanted to learn the names of many other objects and actions. She was curious about many things and learned a great number of words. She also learned to read by using the Braille alphabet. This alphabet allows the reader to feel letters and words, which are represented by bumps on a page. Also Helen learned to talk by feeling and then copying the movements of people's mouths. When Helen Keller was sixteen years old Anne Sullivan went with her to college and acted as Helen's interpreter and Helen was very successful in her studies. After her graduation, Helen dedicated her life to improving conditions for the blind, the deaf and the poor. Anne Sullivan died in 1936 and was remembered as the miracle worker for a triumph in educating Helen Keller. After Anne's death, Helen continued to give lectures and countries around the world, and was active in many political causes. She met with presidents and prime ministers and helped to improve conditions for people who were deaf or blind. At the time of her death in 1968, Helen Keller was one of the most admired people in the world.",176.8635,171.31855922787915,Fast

ielts-listening-0084-cam14-test-1-part-4.wav,"Producing enough energy to meet our needs has become a serious problem. Demand is rising rapidly because of the world's increasing population and expanding industry. Burning fossil fuels like gas, coal and oil seriously damages the environment, and they'll eventually run out. For a number of years now, scientists have been working out how we can derive energy from renewable sources such as the Sun and Wind without causing pollution. Today, I'll outline marine renewable energy, also called ocean energy, which harnesses the movement of the oceans. Marine renewable energy can be divided into three main categories. Wave energy, tidal energy and ocean thermal energy conversion. And I'll say a few words about each one. First, wave energy. Numerous devices have been invented to harvest wave energy with names such as wave dragon, the penguin and mighty whale, and research is going on to try and come up with a really efficient method. This form of energy has plenty of potential as the source is constant and there's no danger of waves coming to a standstill. Electricity can be generated using onshore systems, using a reservoir or offshore systems. But the problem with ocean waves is that they're erratic with the winds making them travel in every direction. This adds to the difficulty of creating efficient technology. Ideally, all the waves would travel smoothly and regularly along the same straight line. Another drawback is that sand and other sediment on the ocean floor might be stopped from flowing normally, which can lead to environmental problems. The second category of marine energy that I'll mention is tidal energy. One major advantage of using the tide rather than waves as a source of energy is that it's predictable. We know the exact times of high and low tides for years to come. For tidal energy to be effective, the difference between high and low tides needs to be at least 5 metres. And this occurs naturally in only about 40 places on earth. But the right conditions can be created by constructing a tidal lagoon, an area of sea water separated from the sea. One current plan is to create a tidal lagoon on the coast of Wales. This will be an area of water within a bay at Swansea, sheltered by a U-shaped breakwater or dam built out from the coast. The breakwater will contain 16 hydro turbines and as the tide rises, water rushes through the breakwater, activating the turbines, which turn a generator to produce electricity. Then, for three hours as the tide goes out, the water is held back within the breakwater, increasing the difference in water level until it's several metres higher within the lagoon than in the open sea. Then, in order to release the stored water, gates in the breakwater are opened. It pours powerfully out of the lagoon, driving the turbines in the breakwater in the opposite direction and again generating thousands of megawatts of electricity. As there are two high tides a day, this lagoon scheme would generate electricity four times a day, every day for a total of around 14 hours in every 24. And enough electricity for over 150,000 homes. This system has quite a lot in its favour, unlike solar and wind energy, it doesn't depend on the weather. The turbines are operated without the need for fuel, so it doesn't create any greenhouse gas emissions and very little maintenance is needed. It's estimated that electricity generated in this way will be relatively cheap and that manufacturing the components would create more than 2,000 jobs, a big boost to the local economy. On the other hand, there are fears that lagoons might harm both fish and birds, for example, by disturbing migration patterns and causing a build-up of silt affecting local ecosystems. There are other forms of tidal energy, but I'll go on to the third category of marine energy, ocean thermal energy conversion. This depends on there being a big difference in temperature between surface water and the water a couple of kilometres below the surface, and this occurs in tropical coastal areas. The idea is to bring cold water up to the surface using a submerged pipe. The concept dates back to 1881.",353.5674375,119.63771409237877,Ideal
ielts-listening-0188-cam8-test-3-part-4.wav,"Good morning, everyone. In the last few lectures I've been dealing with business finance, but now I'm going to move on to business systems. And in today's lecture, I'm going to talk about what can go wrong when businesses try to copy their own best practices. Once a business has successfully introduced a new process, managing a branch bank, say, or selling a new product, the parent organization. Naturally, wants to repeat that success and capture it if possible on a bigger scale. The goal then is to utilize existing knowledge and not to generate new knowledge. It's a less glamorous activity than pure innovation, but it actually happens more often, as a matter of fact. However, surprisingly, getting things right the second time is not necessarily any simpler than it was the first time. Now there's been a lot of research into how companies can repeat their previous successes, and it certainly hasn't been confined to the United States. It seems that most large industries are trying to repeat their own successes and manage the knowledge they've acquired. But even so, it has been shown that the overwhelming majority of attempts fail. A host of studies confirm this, covering a wide range of business settings, branch banks, retail stores, real estate agencies, factories, call centers to name but a few. So why do so few managers get things right the second or third time? Let's consider one reason for failure. Placing too much trust in the people who are running the successful operation, the experts shall we say. Managers who want to apply existing knowledge typically start off by going to an expert, such as the person who designed and is running a successful department store and picking their brains. Now this approach can be used if you want to gain a rough understanding of a particular system or understand smaller, isolated problems. The trouble is, even the expert doesn't fully grasp the whole thing because when it comes to complex systems, the individual components of the process are interwoven with one another. The expert never has complete access to the necessary information. And the situations complicated even further by the fact that experts are usually not aware of their own ignorance. The ignorance can take various forms. For instance, a lot of details of the system are invisible to managers. Some may be difficult to describe, learned on the job, and well known by workers perhaps, but impossible to describe in a way that's helpful. And there are some things that people know or do that they're not even aware of. Now, let's consider two types of mistake that can occur when a manager actually starts to set up a duplicate system to replicate a successful process. Firstly, perhaps he forgets that he was just trying to copy another process and starts trying to improve on it. Another mistake is trying to use the best parts of various different systems in the hope of creating the perfect combination. Unfortunately attempts like these usually turn out to be misguided and lead to problems. Why? Well, for various reasons. Perhaps there weren't really any advantages after all because the information wasn't accurate or perhaps the business settings weren't really comparable. More typically, the advantages are real enough, but there are also disadvantages that have been overlooked. For example, the modifications might compromise safety in some way. So what's the solution? Well, I don't intend to suggest that it's easy to get things right the second time. It's not. But the underlying problem has more to do with attitudes than the actual difficulty of the task, and there are ways of getting it right. These involve adjusting attitudes, first of all. Getting more realistic and cautious, really. Secondly, they involve exerting strict controls on the organizational and operational systems. And this in turn means copying the original as closely as possible. Not merely duplicating the physical characteristics of the factory, but also duplicating the skills that the original employees had.",340.555875,117.86612108805933,Ideal
short-stories-0217-219-thomas-edison.wav,"Thomas Edison. Thomas Edison was one of the most famous inventors of all time. He was born in a small town in the United States during the year 1847. When he was a young boy, Thomas found school to be very boring. A teacher once told Thomas's mother that he believed the young boy was rather stupid. However, Edison's mother knew better. She understood that her son was very intelligent. She then took him away from school and began to teach him herself. As a young man, Thomas Edison became very interested in inventing new machines. One of his first inventions was a small electrical machine that could be used for counting boats. However, the government was not interested in his invention. But Edison was not discouraged. He continued inventing, and his next invention was an electrical machine that could be used for recording the prices of stock. This invention was very popular and successful. Probably the most famous invention of Edison is the electric light bulb. Before Edison, there had been some electric lights, but these were very expensive. In 1879, Edison invented a new kind of light bulb that could shine for a long time. Within a few years, Edison's electric lights were used on the streets of cities in many countries. Soon after, people began using electric lights in their homes. Another invention of Edison's is no longer used today. That invention was called the phonograph. It was a machine that could be used to record sounds, such as music and conversation. When Edison invented this machine in 1877, it was the first time that anyone had been able to preserve sounds. Today, people do not use the phonograph anymore, instead they use compact discs or CDs to record music and other sounds. Edison also helped to improve some inventions that already existed. For example, he made improvements to the telephone and to the cameras that are used in making movies. However, Edison is most famous for his inventions, such as the light bulb and the phonograph. Edison lived to an old age, and he died in 1931. Although Edison was an extremely creative man, he believed that his success was due to many hours of hard work. He once said that genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. In other words, a successful person should have good ideas, but the most important thing is to work very hard.",176.7445,136.46817864205113,Ideal

ielts-listening-0186-cam8-test-3-part-2.wav,"Hello, and welcome to Focus on the Arts. I'm your host, Dave Green, and this is your very own local radio program. Every Friday evening we put the spotlight on different arts and culture facilities and look at the shows and events that are on offer in the coming week. And today the focus is on the National Arts Centre. Now, if you don't already know it yourself, I'm sure you've all heard of it. It's famous throughout the world as one of the major venues for classical music. But did you know that it's actually much more than just a place to hear concerts? The Centre itself is a huge complex that caters for a great range of arts. Under a single roof it houses concert rooms, theatres, cinemas, art galleries and a wonderful public library, as well as service facilities including three restaurants and a bookshop. So, at any one time, the choice of entertainment there is simply enormous. So, how did they manage to build such a big art complex right in the heart of the city? Well, the area was completely destroyed by bombs during the war in 1940. So, the opportunity was taken to create a cultural centre that would be what they called the city's gift to the nation. Of course, it took a while for such a big project to get started, but it was planned in the 60s, built in the 70s and eventually opened to the public in 1983. Ever since then, it has proved to be a great success. It's not privately owned, like many art centres, but is still in public hands. It's run by the city council. Both our national symphony orchestra and national theatre company were involved in the planning of the project and then our base there, giving regular performances every week. And as the centre has opened 363 days of the year, there are plenty of performances to choose from. So, to give you some idea of what's on and to help you choose from the many possibilities, we've made a selection of the star attractions. If you're interested in classical music, then we recommend you go along to the National Unigha Monday or Tuesday evening at 730 for a spectacular production of the Magic Flute, probably the most popular of all Mozart's operas. It's in the Garden Hall and tickets start at only £8, but you'll have to be early if you want to get in that cheap. And remember, it's only on for those two evenings. For those more interested in the cinema, you might like to see the new Canadian film, which is showing on Wednesday evening at 8pm in cinema 2. And that's called Three Lives. It's had fantastic reviews and tickets cost just £4.50, which is a reduction on the usual price of £5.50. So, it's really good value, especially for such a great movie. But you can see the centre's main attraction at the weekend, because on Saturday and Sunday, 11am to 10pm, they're showing a wonderful new exhibition that hasn't been seen anywhere else in Europe yet. It's a collection of Chinese art called Faces of China. That's in Gallery 1, and it has some really fascinating paintings and sculptures by leading artists from all over China. And the good news is that it's completely free, so don't miss it. So, why not go along to the National Art Centre next week for one or all of these great events? And you can always pick up a programme and check out all the other performances and exhibitions on offer, or coming soon, on almost every day of the year. Next week, we'll be looking at the new Museum of Science.",212.2606875,175.82153548805405,Fast

She said that if you are good to people, they will be good to you. If you do bad things, then bad things will come back to you. My mother is always giving me advice. She says that a penny saved is a penny earned. I am still thinking about that one. Some of these things are difficult to understand. My mother is very wise. She says that she has learned from her mistakes. She tells me that she would like me not to make mistakes, but she says that everyone does make mistakes. The important thing is that we learn from our mistakes. My mother says that nobody is perfect. My mother tells my sister that time is precious. My sister wastes time, and my mother doesn't like that. My mother tells me to be true to myself. She says that I should not follow the crowd. I should listen to my own conscience and do what I think is right. She says that it doesn't matter if you fail at something. The important thing is that you try. If you've done your best, then that is all that matters. I listen to my mother. I think she gives very good advice. My mother has a lot of common sense. I hope I am as wise as she is when I have children of my own. Sometimes I wish that she would not give me so much advice.

ielts-listening-0086-cam14-test-2-part-2.wav,"We'll be arriving at Brannley Castle in about five minutes. But before we get there, I'll give you a little information about the castle and what our visit will include. So in fact, there's been a castle on this site for over 1100 years. The first building was a fort constructed in 914 AD for defence against Danish invaders by King Alfred the Great's daughter who ruled England at the time. In the following century, after the Normans conquered England, the land was given to a nobleman called Richard Devere and he built a castle there that stayed in the Devere family for over 400 years. However, when Queen Elizabeth I announced that she was going to visit the castle in 1576, it was beginning to look a bit rundown and it was decided that rather than repair the guestrooms, they'd make a new house for her out of wood next to the main hall. She stayed there for four nights and apparently it was very luxurious, but unfortunately it was destroyed a few years later by fire. In the 17th century, the castle belonged to the wealthy Fenis family who enlarged it and made it more comfortable. However, by 1982 the Fenis family could no longer afford to maintain the castle, even though they received government support and they put it on the market. It was eventually taken over by a company who owned a number of amusement parks, but when we get there I think you'll see that they've managed to retain the original atmosphere of the castle. When you go inside you'll find that in the staterooms there are lifelike moving wax models dressed in costumes of different periods in the past, which even carry on conversations together. As well as that, in every room there are booklets giving information about what the room was used for and the history of the objects and furniture it contains. The castle parks quite extensive, at one time sheep were kept there and in the 19th century the owners had a little zoo with animals like rabbits and even a baby elephant. Nowadays the old zoo buildings are used for public displays of paintings and sculpture. The park also has some beautiful trees, though the oldest of all which dated back 800 years were sadly blown down in 1987. Now you're free to wander around on your own until 430, but then at the end of our visit we'll all meet together at the bottom of the great staircase. We'll then go on to the long gallery where there's a wonderful collection of photographs showing the family who owned the castle a hundred years ago having tea and cakes in the conservatory and we'll then take you to the same place where afternoon tea will be served to you. Now, if you can take a look at your plans you'll see Brannley Castle has four hours joined together by a high wall with the river on two sides. Don't miss seeing the great hall, that's near the river in the main tower, the biggest one which was extended and redesigned in the 18th century. If you want to get a good view of the whole castle you can walk around the walls. The starting point's quite near the main entrance, walk straight down the path until you get to the south gate and it's just there. Don't go on to the north gate, there's no way up from there. There'll shortly be a show in which you can see Archer's displaying their skill with a bow and arrow. The quickest way to get there is to take the first left after the main entrance and follow the path past the bridge. Then you'll see it in front of you at the end. If you like animals there's also a display of hunting birds, falcons and eagles and so on. If you go from the main entrance in the direction of the south gate but turn right before you get there instead of going through it you'll see it on your right past the first tower. At 3pm there's a short performance of traditional dancing on the outdoor stage. That's right at the other side of the castle from the entrance and over the bridge. It's about ten minutes walk or so. And finally the shop. It's actually inside one of the towers but the way in is from the outside. Just take the first left after the main entrance, go down the path and take the first right. It's got some lovely gifts and souvenirs. Right so we're just arriving.",293.38225,157.47373946447,Fast
short-stories-0278-282-the-internet.wav,"The Internet The first working computers in the 1950s and 1960s were large mainframe machines. In some ways they were like large calculating machines. The US government, the military, and businesses and institutions used them for specific tasks. For example, they might be used to handle the payroll. As more uses were found for computers, the need to transfer data from one computer to another became a concern. In 1969, the US government sponsored a program to explore ways for computers to transfer data over telephone lines. The first internet was created with four computers linked together. Of course, computer use increased beyond anyone's expectations. Standards were developed that describe how data was to be transferred between computers. A common language for commands and communications emerged. Operating programs such as MS-DOS, UNIX, Macintosh, and Windows came into existence. The internet quickly expanded beyond government and military uses. The PC became the standard form of computer. Private agencies acted as hosts for Internet usage. Around 1982 there were 213 hosts. By 1986 there were 2300. Today there are millions. The role of computers expanded so quickly that the USSR, which had discouraged computer use, found itself left behind by the USA. Part of the reason for the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989 was that they had fallen too far behind the United States in high-tech areas to ever catch up. One of the most popular uses of the computer is electronic mail or email. You can send a letter by computer over the internet to anywhere in the world in seconds or less. And it doesn't cost anything extra. Now data can be transferred great distances almost instantaneously. Another major internet use is the World Wide Web. In the early days, all web pages were text only. In the 1990s it became possible to make web pages interactive and multimedia. Interactive means that readers could click on items on the web page and get more information. They could also communicate directly with the web page owner. Multimedia means that web pages were no longer text only. They could also have graphics, film, video, and audio. This has helped to turn computers into popular entertainment. Nowadays people spend hours every day surfing the net. However, there are some problems. For some people computers are addictive. Many businesses are trying to control employees using the net during working hours. Since the internet includes just about every kind of information, not all of it is good. You can find directions on how to become a criminal or a terrorist. There are scam artists who want to cheat you out of money. There are also aggressive pornography salesmen not to mention people who want to kill your computer with viruses. Since the internet is not closely regulated, it's up to individual users to follow computer etiquette. Parents need to supervise their children's use of the net. Although the internet is some disadvantages, many people see the net as one of the greatest invention of modern times.",191.5820625,157.5304055409676,Fast

ielts-listening-0022-cam18-test-2-part-2.wav,"Hello everyone, it's good to see that so many members of the public have shown up for our presentation on the new Housing Development Plan on the outskirts of Nunston. I'm Mark Reynolds and I'm Communications Manager at the Development. I'll start by giving you a brief overview of our plans for the development. So one thing I'm sure you'll want to know is why we've selected this particular site for a housing development. A present it's being used for farming, like much of the land around Nunston. But because of the new industrial centre in Nunston, there's a lot of demand for housing for employees in the region. As many employees are having to commute long distances at present. Of course there's also the fact that we have an international airport just 20 minutes drive away. But although that's certainly convenient, it wasn't one of our major criteria for choosing the site. We were more interested in the fact that there's an excellent hospital just 15 kilometres away and a large secondary school even closer than that. One drawback to the site is that it's on quite a steep slope, but we've taken account of that in our planning, so it shouldn't be a major problem. We've had a lot of positive feedback about the plans, people like the wide variety of accommodation types and prices, and the fact that it's only a short drive to get out into the countryside from the development. We were particularly pleased that so many people like the designs for the layout of the development, with the majority of people saying it generally made a good impression and blended in well with the natural features of the landscape, with provision made for protecting trees and wildlife on the site. Some people have mentioned that they'd like to see more facilities for cyclists, and we'll look at that, but the overall feedback has been that the design and facilities of the development make it seem a place where people of all ages can live together happily. OK, so I'll put a map of the proposed development up on the screen. You'll see it's bounded on the south side by the main road, which then goes on to Nunston. Another boundary is formed by London Road on the western side of the development. Inside the development, there'll be about 400 houses and three apartment blocks. There'll also be a school for children up to 11 years old. If you look at the south entrance at the bottom of the map, there's a road from there that goes right up through the development. The school will be on that road, at the corner of the second turning to the left. A large sports centre is planned with facilities for indoor and outdoor activities. This will be on the western side of the development, just below the road that branches off from London Road. There'll be a clinic where residents can go if they have any health problems. Can you see the lake towards the top of the map? The clinic will be just below this, to the right of a street of houses. There'll also be a community centre for people of all ages. On the northeast side of the development, there'll be a row of specially designed houses, specifically for residents over 65, and the community centre will be adjoining this. We haven't forgotten about shopping. There'll be a supermarket between the two entrances to the development. We're planning to leave the three large trees near London Road, and it'll be just to the south of these. It's planned to have a playground for younger children. If you look at the road that goes up from the south entrance, you'll see it curves round to the left at the top, and the playground will be in that curve with nice views of the lake.

ielts-listening-0142-cam11-test-4-part-2.wav,"Good morning and welcome to the museum. One with a remarkable range of exhibits which I'm sure you'll enjoy. My name's Greg and I'll tell you about the various collections as we go around. But before we go, let me just give you a taste of what we have here. Well for one thing, we have a fine collection of 20th and 21st century paintings, many by very well-known artists. I'm sure you'll recognize several of the paintings. This is the gallery that attracts the largest number of visitors, so it's best to go in early in the day before the crowds arrive. Then there are the 19th century paintings. The museum was opened in the middle of that century and several of the artists each donated one work to get the museum started as it were. So there of special interest to us, we feel closer to them than to other works. The sculpture gallery has a number of fine exhibits, but I'm afraid it's currently closed for refurbishment. You'll need to come back next year to see it properly, but a number of the sculptures have been moved to other parts of the museum. Around the world is a temporary exhibition. You've probably seen something about it on TV or in the newspapers. It's created a great deal of interest because it presents objects from every continent and many countries and provides information about their social context, why they were made, who for, and so on. And there's the collection of coins. This is what you might call a focused, specialist collection because all the coins come from this country and were produced between 2000 and a thousand years ago. And many of them were discovered by ordinary people digging their gardens and donated to the museum. All our porcelain and glass was left to the museum by its founder when he died in 1878. And in the terms of his will, we're not allowed to add anything to that collection. He believed it was perfect in itself. And we don't see any reason to disagree. Okay, that was something about the collections and now here's some more practical information in case you need it. Most of the museum facilities are downstairs in the basement, so you go down the stairs here. When you reach the bottom of the stairs, you'll find yourself in a sitting area with comfortable chairs and sofas where you can have a rest before continuing your exploration of the museum. We have a very good restaurant which serves excellent food all day in a relaxing atmosphere. To reach it, when you get to the bottom of the stairs, go straight ahead to the far side of the sitting area, then turn right into the corridor. You'll see the door of the restaurant facing you. If you just want to snack or if you'd like to eat somewhere with facilities for children, we also have a cafe. When you reach the bottom of the stairs, you'll need to go straight ahead, turn right into the corridor and the cafe is immediately on the right. And talking about children, there are baby changing facilities downstairs, across the sitting area, continue straight ahead along the corridor on the left and you and your baby will find the facilities on the left-hand side. The cloakroom where you should leave coats, umbrellas and any large bags is on the left-hand side of the sitting area. It's through the last door before you come to the corridor.

short-stories-0242-245-student-newspapers.wav,"Student newspapers. In North America, most colleges and universities, as well as many high schools, have a student newspaper. These newspapers focus on happenings at the school. They inform the student population about activities on campus and often include world news, which is relevant to student interests. In addition, there are opinion pieces by the student editors, which reflect their views on the school and the world. Some of these editorials oppose the way that the school is being run. Occasionally, school officials will try to shut down or censor student papers if they find they're writing embarrassing or offensive. But usually, these disagreements are resolved by discussion. At some colleges, the student newspaper is connected to a professional program in journalism. But most of the time, the idea behind the paper is to get students to research the facts, debate the issues, and learn how to get their opinions expressed. If these students go on to become professional journalists, that is fine, but it is not really expected. You might wonder whether enough things happen at a college to fill out a weekly paper. Yes, indeed. Schools and universities reflect the real world. There are often problems with the budget and cuts to programs. New buildings go up or are torn down. These change, tuition goes up. Classrooms become crowded and personnel come and go. University Moral and funding often reflect government policies and social attitudes. These tie the college to the larger world. Editorials often comment on how national and world events affect the university. At the same time, there are many things going on within the university. In Disturbs classes, offices are broken into. Computers are stolen. Accidents happen in the parking lot. Students die on the roads during the holidays. Sports teams win or lose. Graduation takes place. Students and instructors win awards. Plays are put on. Distinguished visitors speak. Rock bands are in concert. Then there is always the question of student rights and responsibilities. What kinds of student behavior are unacceptable? Students need to pay attention to student activities off campus. Committees meet with student representation to set guidelines for these matters. Another issue is who sets the agenda for the university. Corporate sponsors today are buying exclusive rights to distribute their products on campus. Governments are expecting universities to follow official policies in order to receive funding. Social groups are demanding that university policies reflect their special interests. So there is no shortage of topics for student journalists to address. Of course, they also write about everything that young people are interested in. Music, movies, computers, sports, travel, and pop culture. Student newspapers are an important training group for democracy. They are also very interesting to read.",184.0849375,147.97517042913952,Ideal
short-stories-0271-274-shopping-at-the-mall.wav,"shopping at the mall. At one time in North America most people shopped downtown on Main Street. Most businesses were at the center of town. When people started using automobiles however they moved away from downtown. In time most people lived in the suburbs. Eventually stores and small shopping plazas were built in suburban areas. Still most of the big stores were downtown. But as more and more cars were on the roads driving and parking downtown became a problem. There wasn't room for a lot of cars to park downtown. People also didn't want to fight downtown traffic just to go shopping. So in the 1950s and 1960s there was the beginning of large suburban shopping malls and plazas. Plazas were a row of stores attached to one another. Malls were usually a double row of stores with a roof connecting both rows. This means that shoppers did all their shopping inside. Large department stores and grocery stores were usually part of the mall but there were many smaller stores as well. When you came to the mall and went inside many people would get a shopping cart. You can walk along the aisles putting your purchases in the cart. When you're finished shopping you can push your shopping buggy out to the car. Many malls also have buggies or strollers for pushing small children along. There can be a lot of walking in a trip to the mall. In fact some people go to the mall just to exercise. A half dozen laps surround the mall every morning amount to a pretty good work out. However there are always places to sit down when you get tired. Most malls have a food court. This is an open area with a lot of tables and chairs. Usually there are a dozen or more small restaurants circled around the food court. The department store is often half full-size restaurants. Malls have large parking lots. Unlike downtown you don't pay to park at the mall. On a busy day, finding a space close to the store can be a challenge. Many people go to the malls when the weather is bad. During which we weather the malls are busy. Likewise, in really hot summer weather people go to the malls to get cool. The climate there is always the same. People don't go to malls just to shop. They also go to meet people. Usually you bump into friends and neighbors there. Old people as well as teenagers go there to see friends. Usually the malls sponsor special events. With lots to see and do malls are a popular place to hang out.",138.81475,191.0459803443078,Fast
The Surprising Benefits Of Saunas And Better English Too Ep 801-1a696a.wav,"Hi there and welcome to this podcast from Adept English. Do you go to the gym? Do you enjoy a sauna? That's SAUNA. I'm thinking about rejoining a gym in the next year and I'd like a gym with a nice swimming pool but one of the things that I would really enjoy about a gym and I've not been a member for a while, having a sauna. The gym I used to go to had both a sauna and a steam room and a jacuzzi but it was the sauna that I enjoyed the most. Let's have a look today at Saunas, what the health benefits are and at the precautions too. Also, the strange dis-inhibition that happens in Saunas, that's dis-inhibition, D-I-S-I-N-H-I-B-I-T-I-O-N. That's a good word and it means that strange effect where people lose their inhibitions, they put down their guard and they talk freely to people that they don't know. If you've had a sauna, you probably know what I mean. So let's have a look at that too. Saunas is an essential part of life for many people. Listen on to find out about not only the benefits for your physical body but also the psychological benefits of sauna and you'll be learning great English as you go of course. This is going to be an English lesson that you'll really enjoy. That's what the depth English aims to provide. Here we go. Hello, I'm Hillary and you're listening to A Depth English. We will help you to speak English fluently or you have to do is listen. So start listening now and find out how it works. So Saunas are beloved amongst people in the Scandinavian countries, especially Finland. And these are the countries that we associate Saunas and Cold Water Swimming with. The idea of Saunas goes back hundreds of years and is part of tradition in these countries. But Saunas is also part of the culture in countries like Russia and Estonia. Once statistic for you, sauna is an everyday event for Finns people in Finland who have 3.3 million Saunas in a country of 5.5 million inhabitants. Saunas is pretty important there then. As I said in my introduction, like many people my experience of sauna is at the gym. The sauna I experienced was probably electrically heated, powered by electricity, a small heater with rocks on the top. You could splash water onto the rocks to provide greater heat and humidity. This is what seems to make the sauna hotter when you're in it. The more traditional type of sauna is wood burning and is located outside. Let's cover the precautions around sauna first of all. Just before I do that, if you would like to work on your English conversation, a debt English can help you even more than we do in the podcast. If you'd like to learn the common vocabulary and the grammar that we use in everyday English conversation, look at our course Activate Your Listening. This course includes lots of conversations between two people. And alongside what I always advise, getting a language partner to practice your English with, this course will really help those of you who are getting ready to start speaking English. Your understanding is great, you can understand the podcasts. Now it's time to start having conversations. So if you're ready to start speaking, check out Activate Your Listening. That's on our website adeptingvish.com. You can download this course and start learning in the next hour. So the precautions of sauna first of all. And this is from the website Harvard Health. Sauners can get as hot as 185 degrees Fahrenheit or 85 degrees Celsius. That's hot. And this can raise the temperature of your skin to as much as 104 degrees Fahrenheit or 40 degrees Celsius. And it can do it very quickly. You can lose about a pint of sweat. That's SWET. That's over half a liter of water from your body, even in just a short time in a sauna. So it needs caution. Your pulse ray, that's P-U-L-S-E, well that rises by 30% or more, meaning that your heart pumps twice as much blood around your body. Most of the extra blood flow is directed towards your skin. That's because your body pushes the blood away from the internal organs and towards the skin as a way of cooling down. Blood pressure or your BP, which is usually given as two numbers. Your blood pressure might be 120 over 70. That's a nice blood pressure. But blood pressure is unpredictable in a sauna. It can go up or down. So that's the first caution. If you have problems with your blood pressure, then sauna is probably not for you. Sauners are safe for most people. But this is what the Harvard Health website advises. Don't mix alcohol or medications that stop you sweating with sauna. Stay in no more than 15 to 20 minutes. Cool down gradually afterwards. Drink two to four glasses of water after every sauna. You need to rehydrate. Don't have a sauna if you feel ill and if you feel at all on well in the sauna, get out straight away. People with heart conditions, multiple sclerosis or pregnant women shouldn't use a sauna. And if you have asthma, A-S-T-H-M-A, which is triggered by high humidity, not a good idea to use the sauna. So that's the precautions taken care of. What about the benefits? I know that for me, I feel great after a sauna, especially in the winter. I can struggle to get warm in the winter. But after a sauna, I feel as though I've been thoroughly warmed through. And my circulation, that's C-I-R-C-U-L-A-T-I-O-N. And I'm talking here about the system that moves blood around your body. Well, after a sauna, it feels like my circulation is working properly for once. Like many women of my age, poor circulation is just something we have. Dead fingers and toes are a thing. No blood in them sometimes. So sauna feels good. I also think I sleep better after a sauna. And just checking out the research on both of those things. Yes, both effects are scientifically proven. People feel more relaxed after a sauna. And some research in 2020 showed that having the sauna regulates the hormones, H-O-R-M-O-N-E-S, that are associated with the body's stress response. So you're more relaxed after a sauna, better sleep. In a small survey of people who had a sauna once or twice a week, 83% said they slept better after a sauna. And having regular soreness does also improve your blood circulation. Your blood vessels dilate D-I-L-A-T-E or widen, and your blood pumps faster around your body. With repeats with frequent soreness, this temporary improvement in circulation leads to generally better circulation, no more dead fingers or toes. If you have any muscle pains or conditions like fibromyalgia or arthritis, sauna can help. Sometimes just warming a muscle can help with the pain. And regular sauna improves the health of your heart. A 20-year study of middle-aged men who used the sauna regularly showed that it improved their overall heart health. And it showed that the more soreness the men had, the less likely they were to die of problems relating to the heart. And in fact, the less likely they were to die of what's called all cause mortality. That means dying of any other condition was less likely too. That's amazing. There were half as many deaths from heart attacks in the group who had four to seven soreness per week compared with the group who just had one. So it appears the more soreness, the better. That statistic alone makes you want to go and have a sauna straight away, doesn't it? Another study following men and women who had soreness over 15 years also had similar results. I've mentioned the word humidity, H-U-M-I-D-I-T-Y. That means the amount of water in the air. And the humidity in a sauna widens the airways and relaxes the lungs. That's L-U-N-G-S. Those are the organs that you breathe with. Again, some great health benefits. Another 20-year study of middle-aged men. What is it with these middle-aged men? Anyway, a 20-year study found that sauna reduced the risk of lung conditions. Like COPD, asthma and pneumonia. Again, what a wonderful benefit. Sauna is believed to boost the immune system at IMM-UNE and reduce inflammation in the body. Another study this time, 11-year study showed that four to seven soreness a week in middle-aged men, of course, reduced problems with inflammation. But these physical health benefits are not all that's going on in the sauna. I mentioned earlier this idea of this inhibition, this inhibition, that's a hard word for me to say, it also happens online, where sometimes people are much freer with their personal information than they would be if they were face-to-face in person with people they didn't know or didn't know well. Somehow, this also happens in the sauna. Inhibitions seem to be removed and people talk about all sorts of things with others that they don't know. It makes me think of the idea of Roman baths, which were obviously popular and a big part of Roman life. I'm thinking of the Roman baths which we saw in Herculaneum last summer. It was a social thing too. And an article in Stylist magazine which was published last week, written by Sophia Hadad had the title and this is your practice in more difficult English, from break up debriefs to the vagaries of new parenthood. Everyone overshares at my sauna. And that habit may be extending our lives. By break up debriefs, Sophia Hadad is talking about the breakup of a relationship and how people often process this by talking about it to other people. A debrief, D-E-B-R-I-E-F, is a military term. So slightly humorous when used in this context. Its original military meaning was when someone was asked lots of questions about a mission they just completed. That's a debrief. But now this word debrief is used to refer to how talking about a difficult experience can help us get over it. Anyway, this inhibition in the sauna. It's a nice place to talk. So people may go together, may go with others that they already know and be chatting, talking in the sauna. In close proximity to other people who join in. You're sitting right next to one another in a tiny space, wearing your swimming gear. At most, perhaps it's hard to ignore someone else's conversation in that situation. And then there's the relaxing effect of the sauna. It relaxes people's boundaries and their conversation too. It's as though those normal social rules are dropped. Perhaps the people you see in the sauna, you'll never see them again. So it doesn't matter. They catch you in a moment of openness, and this prompts for lossafising about relationships, the state of the world, life in general, and there's something really positive about that. Sophia Hadad writes about how important that time of week is for people. When they have their sauna, she herself has really learned to value it and looks forward to her weekly sauna and the conversation that goes with it. Especially so, as hers is a London-based sauna. So what happens in the sauna is a real contrast with the way that Londoners usually interact. Let us know your thoughts and experiences. Do you enjoy a sauna? Is it a tradition in your country? And have you experienced this dis-inhibition effect? Enough for now? Have a lovely day. Speak to you again soon. Goodbye. Thank you so much for listening.

ielts-listening-0020-cam18-test-1-part-4.wav,"For my presentation today, I want to tell you about how groups of elephants have been moved and settled in new reserves. This is known as Translocation, and has been carried out in Malawi in Africa in recent years. The reason this is being done is because of overpopulation of elephants in some areas. The population is a good problem to have, and not one we tend to hear about very often. In Malawi's Majeti National Park, the elephant population had been wiped out by poachers who killed the elephants for their ivory. But in 2003 the park was restocked and effective law enforcement was introduced. This then, not a single elephant has been poached. In this safe environment, the elephant population boomed. Breeding went so well that there were more elephants than the park could support. This led to a number of problems. Firstly, there was more competition for food, which meant that some elephants were suffering from hunger. As there was a limit to the amount of food in the national park, some elephants began looking further afield. Elephants were routinely knocking down fences around the park, which then had to be repaired at a significant cost. To solve this problem, the decision was made to move dozens of elephants from Majeti National Park to Inkotakota Wildlife Park, where there were no elephants. But obviously, attempting to move significant numbers of elephants to a new home, 300 km away, is quite a challenge. So, how did this translocation process work in practice? Elephants were moved in groups of between 8 and 20, all belonging to one family. Because relationships are very important to elephants, they all had to be moved at the same time. A team of vets and park rangers flew over the park in helicopters and targeted a group, which were rounded up and directed to a designated open plane. The vets then used darts to immobilise the elephants. This was a tricky manoeuvre, as they not only had to select the right dose of tranquilizer for different sized elephants, but they had to dart the elephants as they were running around. This also had to be done as quickly as possible, so as to minimise the stress caused. As soon as the elephants began to flop onto the ground, the team moved in to take care of them. To avoid the risk of suffocation, the team had to make sure none of the elephants were lying on their chests, because their lungs could be crushed in this position. So, all the elephants had to be placed on their sides. One person stayed with each elephant while they waited for the vets to do checks. It was very important to keep an eye on their breathing. If there were fewer than six breaths per minute, the elephant would need urgent medical attention. Elephants were fitted to the matriarch in each group, so their movements could be tracked in their new home. Measurements were taken of each elephant's tusks. Elephants with large tusks would be at greater risk from poachers, and also of their feet. The elephants were then taken to a recovery area, before being loaded onto trucks and transported to their new home. The elephants translated to Enkota Kota settled in very well, and the project has generally been accepted to have been a huge success, and not just for the elephants. Employment prospects have improved enormously, contributing to rising living standards for the whole community. Preaching is no longer an issue, as former poachers are able to find more reliable sources of income. In fact, many of them volunteered to give up their weapons, as they were no longer of any use to them. More than two dozen elephants have been born at Enkota Kota since relocation. With an area of more than 1800 square kilometres, there's plenty of space for the elephant population to continue to grow. Their presence is also helping to rebalance Enkota Kota's damaged ecosystem, and providing a sustainable conservation model which could be replicated in other parks. All this has been a big draw for tourism, which contributes five times more than the illegal wildlife trade to GDP, and this is mainly because of the elephants. There's also been a dramatic rise in interest from...",365.017,117.69314853828725,Ideal

ielts-listening-0112-cam13-test-4-part-4.wav,"In my presentation, I'm going to talk about coffee, and its importance both in economic and social terms. We think it was first drunk in the Arab world, but there's hardly any documentary evidence of it before the 1500s, although of course that doesn't mean that people didn't know about it before then. However, there is evidence that coffee was originally gathered from bushes growing wild in Ethiopia in the northeast of Africa. In the early 16th century, it was being bought by traders, and gradually its use as a drink spread throughout the Middle East. It's also known that in 1522, in the Turkish city of Constantinople, which was the centre of the Ottoman Empire, the court physician approved its use as a medicine. By the mid 1500s, coffee bushes were being cultivated in the Yemen, and for the next hundred years, this region produced most of the coffee drunk in Africa and the Arab world. What's particularly interesting about coffee is its effect on social life. It was rarely drunk at home, but instead people went to coffee houses to drink it. These people, usually men, would meet to drink coffee and chat about issues of the day. But at the time, this chance to share ideas and opinions were seen as something that was potentially dangerous, and in 1623, the ruler of Constantinople demanded the destruction of all the coffee houses in the city, although after his death, many new ones opened, and coffee consumption continued. In the 17th century, coffee drinking spread to Europe, and here too, coffee shops became places where ordinary people, nearly always men, could meet to exchange ideas. Because of this, some people said that these places performed a similar function to universities. The opportunity they provided for people to meet together outside their own homes, and to discuss the topics of the day, had an enormous impact on social life. And many social movements and political developments had their origins in coffee house discussions. In the late 1600s, the Yemeni monopoly on coffee production broke down, and coffee production started to spread around the world, helped by European colonization. Europeans set up coffee plantations in Indonesia and the Caribbean, and production of coffee in the colonies skyrocketed. Different types of coffee were produced in different areas, and it's interesting that the names given to these different types, like moccah or Java coffee, were often taken from the port they were shipped to Europe from. But if you look at the labour system in the different colonies, there were some significant differences. In Brazil and the various Caribbean colonies, coffee was grown in huge plantations, and the workers there were almost all slaves. But this wasn't the same in all colonies, for example in Java, which had been colonized by the Dutch, the peasants grew coffee and passed a proportion of this onto the Dutch, so it was used as a means of taxation. But whatever system was used under the European powers of the 18th century, coffee production was very closely linked to colonization. Coffee was grown in every increasing quantities to satisfy the growing demand from Europe, and it became nearly as important as sugar production, which was grown under very similar conditions. However, coffee prices were not yet low enough for people to drink it regularly at home, so most coffee consumption still took place in public coffee houses, and it still remained something of a luxury item. In Britain, however, a new drink was introduced from China, and started to become popular, gradually taking over from coffee, although at first it was so expensive that only the upper classes could afford it. This was tea, and by the late 1700s it was being widely drunk. However, when the USA gained independence from Britain in 1776, they identified this drink with Britain, and coffee remained the preferred drink in the USA as it still is today. So, by the early 19th century, coffee was already being widely produced and consumed. But during this century, production boomed, and coffee prices started to fall. This was partly because new types of transportation had been developed, which were cheaper and more efficient. So now, working people could afford to buy coffee. It wasn't just a drink for the middle classes. And this was at a time when large parts of Europe were starting to work in industries, and sometimes this meant their work didn't stop when it got dark. They might have to continue throughout the night. So the use of coffee as a stimulant became important. It wasn't just a drink people drank in the morning for breakfast. There were also changes in cultivation.",347.9834375,135.00642541356586,Ideal
short-stories-0183-184-australia---nature.wav,"Australia Nature Australia is the only country in the world that is also a continent. Located in the southern hemisphere between the Pacific and Indian oceans, Australia is one of the largest countries in the world. Despite its vast size, Australia does not have a large population. In the year 2000, there were about 19 million people in Australia. Most Australians live within a short distance of the ocean, because much of the interior of Australia is extremely dry. The remote areas of Australia known as the Outback contain several sandy, rocky deserts. Some parts of the Outback receive somewhat more rainfall and can support some grassy vegetation. In these areas, there are many ranches or farms where sheep and cattle are raised. Although the Outback of Australia is a harsh place, some parts of it are quite beautiful. In the middle of the Australian continent, a large red rock known as Uluru stands in the desert. It is nearly 350 meters tall and is nearly 10 kilometers around. Tourists come from all over the world to see this huge and beautiful rock in the middle of a flat desert. In contrast to the dry interior areas, the Northern coast of Australia receives a great deal of rainfall. This area is covered in thick, lush vegetation, with tropical rainforests whose exotic trees and flowers are found nowhere else in the world. Off the northeast coast of the continent, a large coral reef known as the Great Barrier Reef is found. A coral reef is a structure that consists of the bodies of small underwater animals called coral, whose dead bodies create this unusual structure beneath the surface of the water. The reef and the underwater life surrounding it are especially beautiful. Australia was separated from the rest of the world for millions of years. As a result, many of the plant and animal species in Australia are very different from those in other parts of the world. For example, many of the animals in Australia belong to a special category called the marsupials. Marsupials are mammals, but they are a special kind of mammal because they give birth to offspring that are not yet well developed. In many marsupials, the offspring continue to develop after being born inside a pocket or pouch on the mother's body. The most famous marsupial is the kangaroo. Kangaroos can travel at great speeds by hopping on their hind legs and using their large tails for balance. The kangaroo is a rather large animal with a larger individual sometimes weighing 90 kg. Another famous marsupial is the koala. This animal is sometimes called a koala bear because it looks somewhat like a small bear. The koala lives in the branches of trees called eucalyptus trees. Koalos eat the leaves of eucalyptus trees. Of course, Australia also has people. We will discuss the people of Australia in the next passage.",198.2433125,146.48665639099428,Ideal

ielts-listening-0180-cam8-test-1-part-4.wav,"So, welcome to your introductory Geography Lecture. We'll begin with some basics. Firstly, what do we learn by studying geography? Well, we learn a great deal about all the processes that have affected and that continue to affect the Earth's surface. But we learn far more than that, because studying geography also informs us about the different kinds of relationships that develop between a particular environment and the people that live there. Okay, we like to think of geography as having two main branches. There's the study of the nature of our planet, its physical features, what it actually looks like, and then there's the study of the ways in which we choose to live and of the impact of those on our planet. Our current use of carbon fuels is a good example of that. But there are more specific study areas to consider too, and we'll be looking at each of these in turn throughout the semester. These include bio-physical geography, by which I mean the study of the natural environment and all its living things. Then there's topography. That looks at the shapes of the land and oceans. There's the study of political geography and social geography too, of course, which is the study of communities of people. We have economic geography, in which we examine all kinds of resources and their use, agriculture for example. Next comes historical geography, the understanding of how people and their environments and the ways they interact have changed over a period of time, and urban geography. An aspect I'm particularly interested in, which takes as its focus the location of cities, the services that those cities provide, and migration of people to and from such cities. And lastly, we have cartography. That's the art and science of mapmaking. You'll be doing a lot of that. So, to summarize before we continue, we now have our key answer. Studying this subject is important because without geographical knowledge we would know very little about our surroundings and we wouldn't be able to identify all the problems that relate to them. So, by definition, we wouldn't be in an informed position to work out how to solve any of them. Okay, now for some practicalities. What do geographers actually do? Well, we collect data to begin with. You'll be doing a lot of that on your first field trip. How do we do this? There are several means. We might, for example, conduct a census, counterpopulation in a given area, perhaps. We also need images of the Earth's surface which we can produce by means of computer generation technology or with the help of satellite relays. We've come a very long way from the early exploration of the world by sailing ships when geographers only had pens and paper at their disposal. So, we've gathered our information, we must analyse it. We need to look for patterns, most commonly those of causes and consequences. This kind of information helps us to predict and resolve problems that could affect the world we live in. But we don't keep all this information confidential. We then need to publish our findings so that other people can access it and be informed by it. And one way in which this information can be published is in the form of maps. You'll all have used one at some stage of your life already. Let's consider the benefits of maps from a geographers perspective. Maps can be folded and put in a pocket and can provide a great store of reference when they're collected into an atlas. They can depict the physical features of the entire planet if necessary or just a small part of it in much greater detail. But there is a drawback. You can't exactly replicate something that is three-dimensional, like our planet, on a flat piece of paper. Because paper has only two dimensions. And that means there'll always be a certain degree of distortion on a map. It can't be avoided. We can also use aerial photographs. Pictures taken by cameras at high altitude above the earth. These are great for showing all kinds of geographical features that are not easy to see from the ground. You can easily illustrate areas of diseased trees or how much traffic is on the roads at a given time or information about deep sea beds, for example. Then there are land sets. These are satellites that circle the earth and transmit visual information to computers at receiving stations. They circle the earth several times a day and can provide a massive information. You'll all be familiar with the information they give us about the weather, for example. So what we're going to do now is look at a short presentation in which you'll see all these tools.",316.797125,151.51652654676082,Fast

short-stories-0142-143-my-sisters-visit-to-canada.wav,"My sister's visit to Canada. My sister had never been to Canada, but came for a visit last April. I picked her up at the airport in Toronto and drove her through the traffic and multi-lane highways, past the grapevines and peach trees to Niagara Falls where I live. She was very tired from the flight and soon slept. The first day we walked to see the falls. The spray from the falls drifts high into the air and across the people standing to watch. There are people from all over the world watching the water and using their cameras. Because it was April, there was still ice beside the water, huge chunks of ice that looked like white rocks. In the river there were floating pieces of ice moving downstream. The next day we went to the town where the Niagara River joins Lake Ontario. The weather was warm. We walked a long way and our feet were hot, so we went down to the edge of the water to put our feet in. One toe in was enough. The water was so cold it made our feet ache. A piece of ice drifted beside our feet. I put one foot in for a second then out as the pain of the cold went right through me. My sister could not understand how it could be so warm, but there was still ice. Another day we went to see my daughter. She is living on a farm, an hour's drive away. We walked through her trees. The buds were starting to turn into leaves. We stopped and looked at the spring wild flowers. We climbed across a creek by walking over a fallen tree. We saw the footprints of raccoons by the water. There was fresh air and sunshine and blue sky. On the way home we stopped for hamburgers and fries at a drive through restaurant. She had never been to a drive through restaurant before. Then we went to a donut shop. There are no donut shops where she lives. There was a choice of twenty different types of donuts, some round, some with holes, some with frosting, some with jam inside. Which was different. The days passed quickly and soon it was time to take her back to the airport. Some of the trees now had leaves. Some of the tulips were now blooming.

short-stories-0241-242-walmart-stores.wav,"Walmart stores Walmart is now the world's largest retail organization. Walmart employs around 1.2 million people worldwide. In 2000 Walmart had sales of more than $191 billion with profits of $6.3 billion. Profits increased 16% from the previous year. Walmart has come to expect that Walmart's profits will increase substantially every year. Each year more stores are opened and Walmart expands into new countries. Walmart also enters new areas of business nearly every year. Few people know that Walmart is also a major real estate company. Sam Walton opened his Walton's 5-in-Dime in Bentonville, Arkansas in 1950. 12 years later he opened the first Walmart in Bentonville. His business philosophy was simple, good prices, great selection, and a friendly greeting. Walton was known for the 10-foot attitude. This means that any employee should greet any customer who is within 10 feet of them. He emphasized that it is important to speak to people before they speak to you. Walton also believed that good deals from suppliers should be passed along to customers. The combination of low prices and friendly service is basic to Walmart's success. That one store in Bentonville has become 4,203 stores in the USA, plus another 1,000 outside the United States. Walton died in 1992, but his business philosophy continues to be preached at Walmart. Each store has greeters who meet the customers at the door and deal with any special needs they have. Having greeters gives the effect of having more service clerks than Walmart really has. Compared to some other department stores, Walmart has relatively fewer employees. Walmart also has the Walmart Foundation, which sponsors numerous good causes. Among their programs are high school scholarships, fundraising for local hospitals and sick children, environmental concerns, and community matching grant outreach. So what's not to like about Walmart? The main complaint is that their business style is extremely aggressive. Walmarts attitudes towards manufacturers and suppliers are, you do it our way, or we won't do business with you. This puts Walmart at an advantage over smaller retails who don't have the same retailing power. Walmart has been known to demand that its suppliers provide products at discount for Walmart store openings. Levy finds for shipment errors, tell manufacturers what products, styles, and colors to make, etc. Walmart expects product delivery in two days and expects manufacturers to cooperate with its promotional and retailing strategies. In effect, any company that works with Walmart becomes one of their employees. Any company which so dominates one area of the market will have a lot of power. So far, Walmart has been successful in getting what it wants and providing customers with what they want.",189.727375,140.41199905917637,Ideal

ielts-listening-0204-cam7-test-3-part-4.wav,"Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture forms part of the hospitality and tourism module. Last week I looked at the economy end of the hotel business. This week I'm going to discuss the luxury end of the market. Let's consider the following scenario. You wake up in the middle of the night, in a strange hotel miles away from home, disoriented most probably from jet lag, when even the most expensive surroundings can seem empty in dispiriting. You have paid a great deal of money to stay in this first class hotel with its contemporary technology, but according to recent research carried out by an international travel and public relations company all is not well. The research suggests that even the most opulent luxurious hotels seem to have underestimated the most basic needs of their customers, be they traveling for work or pleasure, the need to feel at home in surroundings which are both familiar and inviting. Do these findings however apply only to hotel situated in particular areas? Is it possible that the external environment can affect a guest's well-being? The company's research covered a whole range of different hotel types, both independent hotels and those which are part of large chains. They investigated chic so-called boutique hotels in the heart of downtown business districts. Stately mansions located in the depths of beautiful countryside, and plush hotels built at the edge of tropical beaches surrounded by palm trees and idyllic blue ocean. And the research concluded that what was outside the hotel building simply didn't matter. This is a fascinating revelation, and those of you hoping to move into careers in the travel and leisure industry would be well advised to look at the findings in more detail. But back to the main point of this lecture, the need to feel at home. What can the hotel industry do about it? And is the very idea so subjective that it's impossible to do anything about it on a global basis? However, nothing stands still in this world. One company has come up with a slogan, take your home with you, and aims to provide clients with luxury service departments. News in the business travel industry maintain that these service departments dispense with all the unwanted and expensive hotel services that business travelers don't want, while maximizing the facilities they do want. For example, not only sleeping and living accommodation, but also a sleek modern kitchen that allows guests to cook and entertain, if they wish, at no additional cost. The attractions of such facilities are obvious, and it'll be interesting to see whether the company manages to establish a trend all over the world and make a lasting impact on the luxury accommodation market. Now, finally, I want to consider the psychology underpinning the traditional holiday hotel industry. As a hotelier, how do you go about attracting people to give up the security of their own home and entrust themselves to staying in a completely strange place and sleeping in an unfamiliar bed? Firstly, hotels exploit people's need to escape the predictability of their everyday lives. For a few days, people can pretend they are free of responsibilities and can indulge themselves. Secondly, there is something very powerful in our need to be pampered and looked after. It's almost as if we returned to being a baby when everything was done for us, and we felt safe and secure. And not far removed from this is the pleasure in being spoilt and given little treats. Like the minuscule bottles of shampoo and tiny bars of soap, the chocolate on your pillow at night. And we actually forget that we are paying for it all. Next week, I'm going to look at eco hotels, a fairly new phenomenon, but increasingly popular.",281.5398125,134.26165082780255,Ideal
short-stories-0184-185-australia---people.wav,"Australia, people. The first people who lived in Australia were known as the Aborigines. The Aborigines came to Australia by boat more than 40,000 years ago. They are the first people in the world who are known to have used boats for transportation. Even though many parts of Australia were very inhospitable places, the Aborigines survived. They lived by hunting and gathering throughout the continent, even in the desert areas where survival is almost impossible. The Aborigines felt a deep spiritual attachment to the land, and they made many beautiful paintings upon the rocks of many parts of the country. Their most famous invention is a curved hunting stick known as the boomerang. The design of the boomerang is remarkable because it can be thrown in such a way that it will turn around and return to the person who threw it. Until about 200 years ago, the Aborigines had only a very limited amount of contact with people in the outside world. The next people to migrate to Australia were from the British Isles. Beginning in the late 18th century, Australia was used as a prison colony, where common criminals and political prisoners were sent from Britain. By the middle of the 19th century, many British people moved to Australia voluntarily to begin farms or to search for gold. By the late 19th century, Britain stopped sending its prisoners to Australia, but migration continued. After the arrival of the British colonists, the Aboriginal population declined sharply. This was partly due to disease, partly due to cruel treatment by settlers, and partly due to the loss of their traditional way of life. Today the Aboriginal population is growing again, and the Australian government has taken some steps to correct the injustices of the past. The various parts of Australia were governed at first as separate colonies, but in 1901 they joined to form a single country. Australia continued to grow during the 20th century, and after World War II it attracted many immigrants from countries in Europe. In the past few decades, many people have moved to Australia from various parts of Asia and from other parts of the world. Today, Australia consists of one territory, the Northern Territory, and six states, Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland. Tasmania is a small island off the southern coast, and Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland, are found in the eastern part of the country. The two largest cities in Australia are Sydney and Melbourne, both of which are in the south-eastern part of the country. Sydney has a beautiful harbor that is one of the largest in the world, and Melbourne has many beautiful parks and gardens. The capital city of the country is Canberra, which is located between Sydney and Melbourne. Other large cities in Australia are Brisbane in the northeast, Perth in the southwest, and Atalade in the south.",198.2955625,146.7506364394816,Ideal

short-stories-0257-260-australian-origins.wav,"Australian origins. In many countries, leading families proudly trace their ancestors back to some significant group of people. In the USA, prominent families may boast that their family came over on the Mayflower in 1620. In England, ladies and gentlemen are happy to announce that their ancestors came to Britain with William the Conqueror in 1066. In Australia, however, many leading families are reluctant to talk about their origins. In fact, many years ago, one Australian city burned its early records so that no one would know who their ancestors were. The reason for that is that Australia began its history as a British penal colony. In 18th century England, there was a large gap between the rich and the poor. To make matters worse, many farmers have been forced off their land by powerful landowners. These homeless people wandered to the cities where employment was often hard to find. The government wars gave temporary employment to young men as soldiers and sailors, but when the war was over, they were no better off than before. As a result, theft was extremely common. To protect themselves, the upper class made theft punishable by hanging. The problem with this was that juries were often reluctant to hang someone for stealing something small and might declare the person not guilty. For example, if a man or woman stole a loaf of bread to feed their children, the jury might just let them go. To prevent this, the courts came up with a new category of punishment. Exile or transportation. If the judge or jury was reluctant to sentence the accused to death, they would ship them far away from England across the seas. However, if the person was found back in England again, he or she would be hanged. At first, England sent its convicts to America's 13 colonies. However, when the United States declared its independence in 1776, this was no longer possible. England considered sending criminals to West Africa, but the land and climate were considered unsuitable, so finally, Great Britain decided to use the huge, almost uninhabited country of Australia. At this time, not a single European was living anywhere on the continent. In the fall of 1786, a fleet of English ships began to take convicts on board. This process continued till the sailing date of May 13, 1787. Many British shells had been cleared of both male and female prisoners. Since the convicts were technically under a sentence of death, there was little concern for making them comfortable. At first, the convicts were chained below decks, but later, somewhere released, when well out to sea. One man had been sentenced for theft of a winter coat, another for stealing cucumbers from a garden. A third for carrying off a sheep. Among the women, one was guilty of stealing a large cheese, another of taking several yards of cloth. These ships, known as the First Fleet, carried 1442 convicts, sailors, Marines, and officers. The fleet finally arrived at Botany Bay on January 10, 1788. Later that month, they moved down to Sydney Harbor. No preparations whatsoever had been made. The forest came right up to the shore. Soon the fleet members were cutting down trees and trying to put up tents. It was June 1790 before further supplies arrived from England. Meanwhile, many convicts suffered from sickness aggravated by the lack of good food. In conclusion, Australians need not be ashamed of their origins. In time, great things were achieved, in spite of the almost complete lack of help from the English government. Many ex-convicts became respectable settlers who began prosperous farms and businesses. The members of the First Fleet, whether convicts or not, deserve to be honored as the founders of Australia.",239.4645,156.59941243900454,Fast

This means that a lot of people are dismissed from being jurors without a good reason One principle of the jury system however is to protect the rights of the accused particularly well One might say that the jury system is biased in favor of the defendant This is why defense lawyers have an opportunity to dismiss people who they think will not be favorable to their clients Furthermore having 12 jurors gives the defense a good opportunity for a successful defense if the defense attorney can raise a reasonable doubt about the guilt of his client in Even one juror then the accused has a chance of being released this happened in the OJ Simpson murder trial There even though there was strong evidence that Simpson committed the crime the defense was able to insinuate some doubts among the jurors Moreover the defense lawyers may be able to appeal to the emotions of the jurors Particularly if they can think of a way to gain sympathy for their client for this reason Defense lawyers are more likely to choose trial by jury over trial by judge alone a Judge is less likely to be swayed by emotion than a jury and a defense attorney may also prefer a criminal trial to a civil suit In the latter case the client does not have to be proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt But will be found liable if the preponderance of evidence is against him or her This is why OJ Simpson was acquitted on criminal charges, but then found liable for damages in a civil suit",247.025125,191.3975349673439,Fast

ielts-listening-0244-cam4-test-1-part-4.wav,"Good day ladies and gentlemen. I have been asked today to talk to you about the urban landscape. There are two major areas that I will focus on in my talk. How vegetation can have a significant effect on urban climate and how we can better plan our cities using trees to provide a more comfortable environment for us to live in. Trees can have a significant impact on our cities. They can make a city as a whole a bit less windy or a bit more windy if that's what you want. They can make it a bit cooler if it's a hot summer day in an Australian city or they can make it a bit more humid if it's a dry inland city. On the local scale that is in particular areas within the city trees can make the local area more shady, cooler, more humid and much less windy. In fact trees and planting of various kinds can be used to make city streets actually less dangerous in particular areas. How do trees dole that you ask? Well the main difference between a tree and a building is a tree has got an internal mechanism to keep the temperature regulated. It evaporates water through its leaves and that means that the temperature of the leaves is never very far from our own body temperature. The temperature of a building surface on a hot sunny day can easily be 20 degrees more than our temperature. Trees, on the other hand, remain cooler than buildings because they sweat. This means that they can humidify the air and cool it, a property which can be exploited to improve the local climate. Trees can also help break the force of winds. The reason that high buildings make it windier at ground level is that as the wind goes higher and higher it goes faster and faster. When the wind hits the building it has to go somewhere. Some of it goes over the top and some goes around the sides of the building forcing those high level winds down to ground level. That doesn't happen when you have trees. Trees filter the wind and considerably reduce it, preventing those very large strong gusts that you so often find around tall buildings. Another problem in built-up areas is that traffic noise is intensified by tall buildings. By planting a belt of trees at the side of the road you can make things a little quieter but much of the vehicle noise still goes through the trees. Trees can also help reduce the amount of noise in the surroundings although the effect is not as large as people like to think. Low frequency noise in particular just goes through the trees as though they aren't there. Although trees can significantly improve the local climate they do however take up a lot of space. There are root systems to consider and branches blocking windows and so on. It may therefore be difficult to fit trees into the local landscape. There is not a great deal you can do if you have what we call a street canyon, a whole set of high rises enclosed in a narrow street. Trees need water to grow. They also need some sunlight to grow and you need room to put them. If you have the chance of knocking buildings down and replacing them then suddenly you can start looking at different ways to design the streets and to introduce street plants.",236.851125,147.68770889308632,Ideal
ielts-listening-0066-cam15-test-1-part-2.wav,"Good morning. My name's Erica Matthews, and I'm the owner of Matthews Island Holidays. A company set up by my parents. Thank you for coming to this presentation, in which I hope to interest you in what we have to offer. We're a small family-run company, and we believe in the importance of the personal touch, so we don't aim to compete with other companies on the number of customers. What we do is build on our many years experience, more than almost any other Rail Holiday Company, to ensure we provide perfect holidays and a small number of destinations, which we've got to know extremely well. I'll start with our six-day Isle of Man holiday. This is a fascinating island in the Irish Sea, with whales to the south, England to the east, Scotland to the north, and Northern Ireland to the west. Our holiday starts in Hisham, where your tour manager will meet you, then you'll travel by ferry to the Isle of Man. Some people prefer to fly from Luton instead, and another popular option is to go by train to Liverpool and take a ferry from there. You have five nights in the hotel, and the price covers five breakfasts and dinners, and lunch on the three days when there are organized trips. Day four is free, and most people have lunch in a cafe or restaurant in Douglas. The price of a holiday includes the ferry to the Isle of Man, all travel on the island, the hotel, and the meals I've mentioned. Incidentally, we try to make booking our holidays as simple and fair as possible, so unlike with many companies, the price is the same whether you book six months in advance or the last minute, and there's no supplement for single rooms in hotels. If you make a booking, then need to change the start date, for example because of illness, you're welcome to change to an alternative date or a different tour for a small administrative fee. Okay, so what does the holiday consist of? Well, on day one, you'll arrive in time for a short introduction by your tour manager, followed by dinner in the hotel. The dining room looks out at the river, close to where it flows into the harbour, and there's usually plenty of activity going on. On day two, you'll take the coach to the small town of Peel, on the way, calling in at the Tinworld exhibition. The Isle of Man isn't part of the United Kingdom, and it has its own parliament called Tinworld. It's claimed that this is the world's oldest parliament that's still functioning, and that it dates back to 979. However, the earliest surviving reference to it is from 1422, so perhaps it isn't quite as old as it claims. Day three, we have a trip to the mountain Snavel. This begins with a leisurely ride along the promenade in Douglas in a horse drawn tram. Then you board an electric train which takes you to the fishing village of Laxie. From there, it's an eight kilometre ride in the Snavel mountain railway to the top. Lunch will be in the cafe, giving you spectacular views of the island. Day four is free for you to explore, using the pass which will give you. So you won't have to pay for travel on local transport or for entrance to the island's heritage sites. Oh, you might just want to take it easy and Douglas and perhaps do a little light shopping. The last full day, day five, is for some people the highlight of the holiday, with a ride on the steam railway from Douglas to Port Aaron. After some time to explore, a coach will take you to the headland that overlooks the cap of man, a small island just off the coast. From there, you continue to Castle Town, which used to be the capital of the Isle of Man and its medieval castle. And on day six, it's back to the ferry or the airport if you flew to the island and time to go home. Now, I'd like to tell you a bit more.",279.2791875,149.74262985493684,Ideal
short-stories-0268-271-henry-ford.wav,"Henry Ford. Some inventions are based on simple ideas or principles. Barometers are based on the idea that air has weight and pushes down on objects. A barometer measures this air pressure. Evangelista Teracelli invented barometers in Italy in 1643. Other inventions have taken longer to develop. The automobile has thousands of parts and it took a long time to make a really useful car. Henry Ford was one of the first people to make a reliable automobile. In 1765 James Watt invented the steam engine. Within a few years a Frenchman Nicholas Cunul had built a steam-powered vehicle. These steam carriages were used in England in the 1800s, but they were big and slow. They looked like a train without the tracks. Most people preferred to travel by train. In Germany during the 1870s and 1880s, Nikolaus Otto and Gottlieb Diemler developed the internal combustion engine. This ran by burning gasoline. Another German, Karl Benz, built a gasoline-powered car. Around the world there were many inventors trying to build a car that would be better than the one before. Some people thought that electric cars would become common. In the 1890s several inventors working in the United States developed a gasoline-powered car that was practical for daily use. Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863. As a boy he loved to take clocks and watches apart and reassemble them. Eventually he went to work for the Detroit Edison Company. In his spare time he worked on a horseless carriage, as the early cars were called. In 1896 he completed a car that ran smoothly. He later sold it and made another one. Since early cars were made by hand, they were usually quite expensive. Not only that, but when they broke down, there were no repair shops to take them to. One had to know how to repair a car oneself. Henry Ford tried to make cars which would be affordable and which would not break down very easily. His Ford Motor Company was formed in 1903 in Detroit, Michigan. Since many parts had to be brought together to make a car, Ford developed the assembly line. On the line each worker would do one specific job. When the car reached the end of the assembly line, it was finished. In this way, many cars could be made in a single day. The result was that Ford was able to bring the price of cars down. Ford's model T-car was advertised as being as frisky as a jackrabbit and more durable than a mule. Since it cost hundreds rather than thousands of dollars, many ordinary families were now able to buy a car. Once many people had cars, their habits began to change. People didn't have to live next to the factories or offices that they worked in. Going for Sunday drives or traveling to tourist sites became a common thing. In 1905, a car drove across the United States and back again. In 1912, a car went across Canada from coast to coast. Soon there was public pressure for good roads so that cars could travel anywhere in North America. Henry Ford was not the only inventor of the modern car. However, he was able to make a car that everyone could use and afford.",209.97225,157.44937723913517,Fast
ielts-listening-0128-cam12-test-4-part-4.wav,"This lecture will be about the science of acoustics, the study of sound, in relation to urban environments such as cities. As an acoustic engineer myself, I think this is an area where we're likely to see great changes. In the past, researching urban soundscapes was simple. We measured levels of sound in decibels, so I used to take my sound meter, and I measured the noise somewhere, and then I might ask a sample of people to say at what level the sound became annoying. With data like this, acoustic engineers have been able to build up what we call noise maps, maps of the sound environment. But actually, these aren't a lot of use. What they do show is that the highest noise levels are generally on roads. Well, that's not really very surprising. But there's quite a lot going on that these maps don't show, because they can't capture the complex way that sound varies over time. So they ignore important issues such as the noise someone might hear from the open windows or gardens of their neighbors. And this sort of noise can be quite significant in summer. We don't have any databases on this sort of information. As well as that, these records of sound levels take no account of the fact that people vary in their perceptions of noise. So someone like me with years of working in acoustics might be very different from you in that regard. But anyway, even though these noise maps are fairly crude, they've been useful in providing information and raising awareness that noise matters, we need to deal with it, and so it's a political matter. And that's important. We need rules and regulations, because noise can cause all sorts of problems. Those of you who are city dwellers know that things go on 24 hours a day, so city dwellers often suffer from interrupted sleep. There's also known that noise can lead to a rise in levels of stress, due to physical changes in the body, affecting the composition of the blood. And there are other problems as well. For instance, if schoolchildren don't have a quiet place to study, their work will suffer. Now one problem with decibel measurement is that it doesn't differentiate between different types of noise. Some types of sounds that most people would probably think of as nice and relaxing might well score quite highly in decibel levels. Think of the sound made by a fountain in a town square, for example. That's not necessarily something that we'd want to control or reduce. So maybe researchers should consider these sorts of sounds in urban design. This is going to be tricky, because just measuring decibel levels isn't going to help us here. Instead many researchers are using social science techniques, studying people's emotional response to sound by using questionnaires and so on. So what exactly do people want to hear in an urban environment? Some recent interdisciplinary research has come out with results that at first sight seem contradictory. A city needs to have a sense of activity, so it needs to be lively, with sounds like the clack of high heels on a pavement or the hiss of a coffee machine. But these mustn't be too intrusive, because at the same time we need to be able to relax. One of the major problems in achieving this will be getting architects and town planners to use the research. Apart from studying the basics of acoustics, these people receive very little training in this area. But in fact, they should be regarding sound as an opportunity to add to the experience of urban living. Whereas at present, they tend to see it as something to be avoided or reduced as far as possible, or something that's just a job for engineers, like the street drainage system. What's needed is the noise in cities to be regarded as an aesthetic quality, as something that has the qualities of an art form. If we acknowledge this, then we urgently need to know what governs it and how designers can work with it. We need to develop a complex understanding of many factors. What is the relationship between sound and culture? What can we learn from disciplines such as psychology about the way that sound interacts with human development and social relationships? And the way that sound affects our thoughts and feelings? Can we learn anything from physics about the nature of sound itself? Today's powerful technologies can also help us. To show us their ideas and help us to imagine the effect their buildings will have, architects and town planners already use virtual reality. But these programs are silent. In the future, such programs could use realistic sounds, meaning that sound shapes could be explored before being built. So hopefully, using the best technology we can layer hands on, the city of the future will be a pleasure to the ears, as well as the eyes.",341.401875,146.22063806767318,Ideal
Ds_paper_discussion.wav,"This is not official lectures, so I just want to discuss the questions and support students that say. So don't record and share it. It will be unnecessary problem. Right. Okay. Let's see. I don't know whether my voice is clear today or not because I'm not well. Anyway, let's see how to do this session. All right. So I'll take a few questions from transaction and concurrency control and explain you how to write answers for that question. I think in the paper, IT 3020 paper, IT student's paper, indexing question, you should be able to get a good mark and transaction and concurrency control question that also is you want if you study little and should be able to get good mark for that. And then the object relational model question that also is a question if you are good in S.K. Well, only complicated question is a query optimization question. So you should plan to get more marks from other three questions. And then if you get some marks from the question, IT 3 query optimization question, you should be able to go for a good grade easily. So let's see. I think most of them here is repeat in these students or then maybe your target is to get pass mark. So with those three questions, it is easy to be able to get a pass mark if you answer well. Right. If you really want to get a good marks for the query optimization question, you may have respect reasonable time. That's that's obvious thing. You can't do overnight that. Right. So let's start this. Let me share one of the paper and start. Let's start with the 2019 paper. I'm doing this assuming that you will have already gone through the question and answers to them. So I shared these papers sometimes back and asked you to answer. So this is 2019 paper. Let me jump into a transaction. In this paper, the question is the transaction and concurrency control that date has given 30 marks. I think this year equal marks for questions and 25 marks for the transaction and concurrency control. So this year, well, every question, same big. So you get a two question, a relational model question, 25 marks indexing question, 25 marks, transaction and concurrency control, 25 and the other one is query optimization, 25 marks. So let's say this question. Some of them are still in the waiting room. I can see if someone can accept them that may be easy for me. Okay. I'll just say that. Okay. I'll just say that. Okay. I'll just say that. I'll just say that. I'll just say that. I'll just say that. I'll just say that. I'll just say that. I'll just say that. I'll just say that. I'll just say that. I'll just say that. I'll just say that. I'll just say that. I'll just say that. I'll just say that. I'll just say that. I'll just say that. I'll just say that. I'll just say that. That. That. That. Is anyone wants to add something? If you want to ask questions during the session or problem, you can. Unmute and ask. That. Questions. But. Other time you want to. Mute it. Just to avoid unnecessary. Noises. Right. So in this question. Transsection. And. Concurrency control. Couple of things. You want to know like if I. If I. If I. Quickly. Quickly. The. The main things you want to know for this. Topika. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. Talks, together. That. And. Right. And. And, Copy that. Even. So these four students. Do you want to know. Before that. And. And. If there's, Is. Then. Is it. Properties, you want to know. Before. Transsection. Ja. schedules. So there we are in undergraduate level, we are talking about three type of schedules, called serial schedule, equivalent schedule and serial status. Those schedules, you are going to differences between these things. And then when scheduling, since we want to do things parallelly, concurrency, concurrency, so then there can be conflicts. So then three types of conflicts can happen in a schedule schedule. Since we are interleaving actions, interleaving actions, can we have a transaction, a transaction, a transaction, a sequence of read, right? So then read, write, read, write, maybe like with multiple schedule commands, it creates a sequence of read, that we call a transaction. So then with multiple transactions, fairly, there can be conflicts, right? The three types of conflicts can happen. One of the two T1, T2, T2, T1, read, read, read, read, read, read, read, read, read, read, be a conflict. But at least one hundred T2 is there. So both of them are at the same time, no conflict. We will see the same value, say, as example, like in the IKIL, so equal 10. So then both of them read as 10, 10, no conflict. But at least one person is changing A into another different value and another person is reading. So it's going to be a conflict. So what actual value should consider? Say then write a read a conflict. Read a write a conflict. Write a write a conflict. So these three things are conflicting when things happen, fairly, right? So then in the schedule, the next thing, since we want to do things parallarily, concurrently. So then three kind of conflicts can happen. We call it anomalies. Three types of anomalies are there. Write, read anomaly, read, write anomaly, write, write anomaly. Read, write, we call it, can you remember? Dirty reads. Read, write, we call it unreadable reads. Write, write, we call it, or write in uncommitted data. So these three things we call three types of anomalies, or three types of conflicts. And so then, which should be able to avoid these three types of conflicts from schedules, then only we can get serializable schedules.",537.876,111.77297369653974,Ideal

It's good to see so many parents and children here tonight and I know you're looking forward to a great football season. Now, I'd like to take a few minutes to tell you about some changes to the soccer club for the coming season. Now, this season we'll be playing all our matches for both the junior and senior competitions at Kings Park instead of Royal Park which was used last season. Now, for meetings we're going to use the clubhouse in Kings Park and the next meeting will be held in the clubhouse on the 2nd of July. As usual we hope to begin the season with a picnic next Saturday at the clubhouse. Please try and come to the picnic as it's always good fun. At the last week of the season we usually have a dinner and presentation of prizes to the players and more information about this will be given to you later in the season. This season we have more teams than ever. We hope to have 10 teams instead of 5 in the junior competition and they will play on Saturday mornings beginning at 8.30am. Training sessions will be held in Kings Park on Wednesday afternoons for the juniors and they will be wearing red shirts again this year. In the senior competition there will be 4 teams same as last year and their games will be played on Saturday afternoons starting at 2.30pm. Sorry, it will be at 2pm start and the training session for seniors is planned for Sunday afternoons. Now, I'd like to introduce you to the new committee for the soccer club for this season. Firstly, let me welcome Robert Young, the new president who will manage the meetings for the next 2 years. Robert's son has been playing football with the club for over 5 years now and many thanks to Robert for taking on the job of president. Next we have Gina Costello. She's the treasurer and she'll collect the fees from you for the season. Please try and give Gina your fees as early as possible in the season as the club needs the money to buy some new equipment. Then there's David West who's volunteered to be the club secretary and one of the many jobs he'll have is to send out newsletters to you regularly. If you have any information that may be useful, please let David know so that it can be included in these newsletters. Also, I'd like to introduce you to Jason Dokech who is the Ed Coach. For all the new members here tonight, this is the third year that Jason has been with us as Ed Coach and we're very lucky to have such an experienced coach and former player at our club. He will continue to supervise the teams at training sessions and on match days.

short-stories-0262-265-dr-norman-bethune.wav,"Dr. Norman Bithune Some people find their vocation early in life. Others do not discover their life's work until they are older. Norman Bithune tried many things before he fully recognized his true work. Bithune was born in Gravenhurst, Ontario in 1890. He was the son of a Presbyterian clergyman. The family moved frequently, and many of the places they lived were close to lakes, rivers, and woods. As a young man, Norman loved the outdoors. He became a good swimmer and skater. He also showed that he had a strong, independent streak. He hated rules, but also had a strong sense of justice. The young man studied science at the University of Toronto from 1909 to 1911. After that, he worked for Frontier College. This was a volunteer organization where instructors did the same jobs as local workers during the day and taught them English in the evening. He then returned to Toronto to study medicine. Early in World War I, he joined the Army Medical Corps. He reached France in February 1915, but was wounded in April, and eventually returned to Canada. He went back to the war in 1917. At the end of the war, he continued to study medicine in London, England. While he was in England, he married a Scottish woman, Francis Campbell Penny. Although Bethune loved her very much, their marriage ended in divorce in 1927. The couple moved to Detroit, Michigan in 1924, where Bethune opened a medical practice. In the middle of his growing success, he contracted tuberculosis. This was a low point in Bethune's life. Thinking that he was going to die, he considered suicide. One day, however, he read of a new treatment for tuberculosis, and insisted that his doctors perform the operation on him. As a result, Bethune recovered. The year was 1927. For some years after, Bethune devoted himself to the treatment of tuberculosis patients. However, he began to notice a pattern. Rich patients who could afford proper medical care usually recovered. Poor patients usually died. Bethune became a supporter of government-funded medical care. Bethune admired the government-funded health system in communist Russia. He was angry when Canada would not support his idea about Medicare. Bethune wanted to change the world, and communism seemed like the most promising method. In 1936, Bethune went to Spain to help the Republicans fight the fascists. He was appalled to see the fascists, allies, Germany and Italy, dropping bombs on women and children. He developed a hatred for fascism. He also decided that doctors should go to the front, rather than wait for the wounded to be brought to them. In Spain, he developed a blood transfusion service, which saved many lives. Returning to North America, Bethune heard about the Japanese attack on China in 1937. Early in 1938, he sailed for China. Bethune had joined the Communist Party. Now he went to join the army of Mosay Tong in northern China. Mos' army was suffering badly from Japanese attacks. They had hardly any doctors or medical supplies. Bethune's only made Bethune work harder. He soon organized a hospital, trained medical workers, and wrote textbooks. He insisted on operating right at the front to give the wounded a better chance of survival. He went for days without sleep and gave his own blood to help the wounded. In November 1939, he died from blood poisoning, but his work lived on. In 1973, the Canadian government bought his house that he was born in and turned it into a museum.

ielts-listening-0076-cam15-test-3-part-4.wav,"Nowadays, we use different products for personal cleanliness, laundry, dishwashing and household cleaning, but this is very much a 20th century development. The origins of cleanliness date back to prehistoric times. Since water is essential for life, the earliest people lived near water and knew something about its cleansing properties, at least that it rinsed mud off their hands. During the excavation of ancient Babylon, evidence was found that soap-making was known as earliest 2,800 BC. Archaeologists discovered cylinders made of clay, with inscriptions on them saying that fats were boiled with ashes. This is a method of making soap, though there's no reference to the purpose of this material. The early Greeks bathed for aesthetic reasons and apparently didn't use soap. Instead, they cleaned their bodies with blocks of sand, pumice and ashes, then anointed themselves with oil and scraped off the oil and dirt with a metal instrument known as a strygel. They also used oil mixed with ashes. Clothes were washed without soap in streams. The ancient Germans and Gauls are also credited with discovering how to make a substance called soap, made of melted animal fat and ashes. They used this mixture to tint their hair red. It got its name, according to an ancient Roman legend, from Mount Sappho, where animals were sacrificed, leaving deposits of animal fat. Rain washed these deposits, along with wood ashes, down into the clay soil along the river tuba. Women found that this mixture greatly reduced the effort required to wash their clothes. As Roman civilization advanced, so did bathing. The first of the famous Roman baths supplied with water from their aqueducts was built around 312 BC. The baths were luxurious and bathing became very popular. And by the second century AD, the Greek physician Galen recommended soap for both medicinal and cleansing purposes. After the fall of Rome in 467 AD and the resulting decline in bathing habits, much of Europe felt the impact of filth on public health. This lack of personal cleanliness and related unsanitary living conditions were major factors in the outbreaks of disease in the Middle Ages, and especially the black death of the 14th century. Nevertheless, soap-making became an established craft in Europe and associations of soap-makers guarded their trade secrets closely. Vegetable and animal oils were used with ashes of plants, along with perfume, apparently for the first time. Gradually, more varieties of soap became available for shaving and shampooing, as well as bathing and laundering. A major step toward large-scale commercial soap-making occurred in 1791 when a French chemist Nicholas Le Blanc patented a process for turning salt into soda ash or sodium carbonate. Soda ash is the alkali obtained from ashes that combines with fat to form soap. The Le Blanc process yielded quantities of good quality, inexpensive soda ash. Modern soap-making was born some 20 years later, in the early 19th century, with a discovery by Michel Eugène Chèvreul, another French chemist, of the chemical nature and relationship of fats, glycerine, and fatty acids. His studies established the basis for both fat and soap chemistry, and soap-making became a science. Further developments during the 19th century made it easier and cheaper to manufacture soap. Until the 19th century soap was regarded as a luxury item, and was heavily taxed in several countries. As it became more readily available, it became an everyday necessity, a development that was reinforced when the high tax was removed. soap was then something ordinary people could afford, and cleanliness standards improved. With this widespread use came the development of milder soaps for bathing and soaps for use in the washing machines that were available to consumers by the turn of the 20th century.",309.7293125,120.10487383237259,Ideal
ielts-listening-0288-ielts-recent-actual-test-4-part-4.wav,"When considering the smallest unit of matter, the atom, most people know of electrons, protons and neutrons, but almost none know of another particle, even though they are constantly emitted from the sun in the trillions, with 100 to 200 billion of them regularly passing through your body every second. To repeat, that's not thousands, not millions, but billions every second. You don't feel them because they are small. In fact, so tiny that we can barely detect their presence at all. These mysterious particles are called neutrinos. Despite such an abundance, detecting them is a huge undertaking, and there are many reasons for this. Firstly, the neutrino itself is so small that you need to eliminate absolutely all other particles around. To do this, you need what is called a clean room, one that has an extremely low level of dust, microbes, floating particles or chemical vapors. You probably don't know it, but the air around you right now has almost 40 million particles per cubic meter. In contrast, the cleanest of clean rooms has less than 10. The second problem is that you also need an environment with absolutely no background radiation. At the surface of the earth such radiation is all around, from the sun and sky and from TVs and communication devices. The only way to screen out all that is to go underground, and I mean deep underground. For example, the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory in Canada uses an old nickel mine, one of the deepest in the world, and puts the observatory in its lowest tunnel, more than two kilometers below the surface. At such depths, stray radiation is sufficiently screened out to allow neutrinos only to pass by. The final problem is that you need an elaborate detection system, and this apparatus is huge, and its installation in this deep underground cavity presents quite a headache. Holding such a weighty construction safe and secure requires complex engineering work, such as rock bolting and support structuring. This obviously requires great care and takes a lot of effort. So I've told you about the difficulty in detecting neutrinos. They are tiny, virtually weightless, have no electric charge, and hardly interact with anything at all. Yet we can detect them, and to see how, let's consider the Sudbury installation once again. The detector there consists of a spherical container filled with heavy water. This rests inside another vessel filled with normal water, which helps support the weight of the inner sphere, as well as providing further shielding from any stray radiation. At the edge of this inner sphere are about 10,000 electronic detectors. These are extremely sensitive, able to multiply 100 million times any electric current which occurs. So as the neutrinos pass through this sphere of water, there is a very, very, very small chance that one of them may hit a water molecule. To increase the likelihood of this, two strategies are used. One, the larger the sphere of water, the better, and the Sudbury tank holds not 10 tons, not 100 tons, but 1000 tons. Two, the water is special, consisting as it does of heavier molecules. So what happens is this. If the neutrino hits the water molecule, the neutrino is absorbed, but the molecule itself splits apart, producing a tiny electric current. It is this which is detected and analyzed, giving key information about the neutrino. The final question is why do we care about these elusive particles? Well, just think. They can pass right through the core of our Sun at the speed of light without being affected or losing strength. No other form of radiation can do that, meaning that the knowledge we get about neutrinos can help us to control them. With this ability, we can probe the center of our Earth, the inner layers of our Sun, and the outer limits of our solar system. And that makes it all worth the effort.",288.590625,136.17905987070787,Ideal
ielts-listening-0124-cam12-test-3-part-4.wav,"Okay, so we've been looking at how man-made changes in our environment can affect wildlife. Now, I'll discuss a particular example. Let's take a look at Mercury. Mercury is one of the 120 or so elements that make up all matter, and it has the symbol HG. It's a shiny, silvery substance. You may have seen it in old-fashioned thermometers, but it's not used much for domestic purposes now because it's highly toxic. But the problem is that the amount of mercury in the environments increasing. The main reason for this is the power plants used to produce electricity. The main source of energy that most of them use is still coal. And when it's burned, it releases mercury into the atmosphere. Some of this gets deposited into lakes and rivers. And if it's ingested by a fish, it's not excreted. It stays in the fish's body, and it enters the food chain. So, it's been known for some time that birds which eat fish may be affected. But what wasn't known until quite recently is that those that eat insects can also be affected. So, a woman called Claire Varian-Ramos is doing some research on how this is affecting birds. And rather than looking at how many birds are actually killed by mercury poisoning, she's looking for more subtle, sub-effects. And these may be to do with the behavior of the birds, or with the effect of mercury on the way their brain works. So, whether it leads to problems with memory, for example. And she's particularly focusing on the effects of mercury on bird's song. Now, the process of song learning happens at a particular stage in the birds' development. And what you may not know is that a young bird seems to acquire this skill by listening to the songs produced by its father, rather than by any other bird. And Varian-Ramos has already found in her research that if young male birds are exposed to mercury, if they eat food contaminated with mercury, then the songs they produce aren't as complex as those produced by other birds. So, quite low-level exposure to mercury is likely to have an impact on male birds in a natural situation, because it can mean that they're less attractive to female birds, and so it can affect their chances of reproduction. Now, the way she's carrying out this research is worth thinking about. She's using a mixture of studies, using birds kept in laboratories, and studies carried out outdoors in the wild. The lab-based studies have the advantage that you don't get all the variables you would in a natural setting. So, the experimenter has a much higher level of control, and that means they can be more confident about their results in some ways. And of course, they don't have to worry about going out and finding the birds in order to observe them. So, what are the implications here for humans? Well, because many birds are migratory, they may be transporting mercury far from contaminated sites. For example, it's been found that ducks who'd been feeding at a contaminated site were later shot by hunters over a thousand kilometres away, and presumably eaten. But these birds likely had mercury levels high enough to warrant concern for human consumption. In addition, going back to song-learning by birds, we saw that this may be affected by mercury contamination. Well, we also know that in humans, mercury causes developmental delays in the acquisition of language, and in fact this process is very similar in the brain regions it involves, and even the genes that are involved. But mercury contamination has other important implications for humans as well. It's now known that an unborn child can be affected if the food eaten by its mother contains high levels of mercury, and these effects can be quite substantial. In the end, it comes down to whether more value is placed on human economic well-being or environmental well-being. It's true there are new regulations for mercury emissions from power plants, but these will need billions of dollars to implement and increase costs for everyone. Some argue that's too much to pay to protect wildlife. But as we've seen, the issues go beyond that, and I think it's an issue we need to consider very carefully.",353.1028125,122.3439702848586,Ideal

ielts-listening-0036-cam17-test-1-part-4.wav,"Labyrinths have existed for well over 4000 years. Labyrinths and labyrinthine symbols have been found in regions as diverse as modern-day Turkey, Ireland, Greece and India. There are various designs of labyrinth, but what they all have in common is a winding spiral path which leads to a central area. There is one starting point at the entrance and the goal is to reach the central area. Finding your way through a labyrinth involves many twists and turns, but it's not possible to get lost as there is only one single path. In modern times the word labyrinth has taken on a different meaning and is often used as a synonym for a maze. A maze is quite different as it is a kind of puzzle with an intricate network of paths. Mases became fashionable in the 15th and 16th centuries in Europe and can still be found in the gardens of great houses and palaces. The paths are usually surrounded by thick, high hedges so that it's not possible to see over them. Entering a maze usually involves getting lost a few times before using logic to work out the pattern and find your way to the centre and then out again. There are lots of dead ends and paths which lead you back to where you started. The word maze is believed to come from a Scandinavian word for a state of confusion. This is where the word amazing comes from. Labyrinths on the other hand have a very different function. Although people now often refer to things they find complicated as labyrinths, this is not how they were seen in the past. The winding spiral of the labyrinth has been used for centuries as a metaphor for life's journey. It served as a spiritual reminder that there is purpose and meaning to our lives and helped to give people a sense of direction. Labyrinths are thought to encourage a feeling of calm and have been used as a meditation and prayer tool in many cultures over many centuries. The earliest examples of the labyrinth spiral pattern have been found carved into stone from Sardinia to Scandinavia, from Arizona to India to Africa. In Europe these spiral carvings date from the late Bronze Age. The Native American Pima tribe were of baskets with a circular labyrinth design that depicted their own cosmology. In ancient Greece the labyrinth spiral was used on coins around 4,000 years ago. Labyrinths made of mosaics were commonly found in bathhouses, villas and tomes throughout the Roman Empire. In northern Europe there were actual physical labyrinths designed for walking on. These were cut into the turf or grass, usually in a circular pattern. The origin of these walking labyrinths remains unclear, but they were probably used for fertility rights which may date back thousands of years. Eleven examples of turf labyrinths survived today, including the largest one at Safran Wald in England, which used to have a large tree in the middle of it. More recently labyrinths have experienced something of a revival. Some believe that walking a labyrinth promotes healing and mindfulness, and there are those who believe in its emotional and physical benefits, which include slower breathing, and a restored sense of balance and perspective. This idea has become so popular that labyrinths have been laid into the floors of spars, wellness centres and even prisons in recent years. A pamphlet at Colorado Children's Hospital informs patients that walking a labyrinth can often calm people in the midst of a crisis. And apparently it's not only patients who benefit. Many visitors find walking a labyrinth less stressful than sitting in a corridor or waiting room. Some doctors even walk the labyrinth during their breaks. In some hospitals patients who can't walk can have a paper finger labyrinth brought to their bed. The science behind the theory is a little sketchy, but there are dozens of small-scale studies which support claims about the benefits of labyrinths. For example, one study found that walking a labyrinth provided short-term calming, relaxation and relief from anxiety for Alzheimer's patients. So what is it about labyrinths that makes their appeal so universal?",295.905625,140.92330958561536,Ideal

short-stories-0168-169-the-vikings.wav,"The Vikings. About a thousand years ago, people known as the Vikings were known and feared throughout Europe. The Vikings were the people of the northern part of Europe called Scandinavia, which includes the modern countries of Denmark, Norway and Sweden. The Vikings made their living by farming and fishing. However, by about the year 700 they began making attacks or raids upon town. Upon towns along the coast of Europe, in order to steal the wealth of those towns. The Vikings made their attacks very quickly and without any warning. They were very cruel to the people of the towns they attacked and they sometimes destroyed the towns by burning down the buildings. In some parts of Europe, the local kings would often fight against the Vikings. Sometimes however, the kings would pay the Vikings in order to persuade them not to attack. Although the Vikings were known as fierce warriors, they also built excellent ships. The wooden Viking ships called long boats were able to sail even in very bad weather. Many Viking long boats were about 20 meters long, but some were nearly 90 meters long. The Vikings sailors used both sails and oars to move their ships. The Vikings traveled across a large area. They made many of their attacks in Britain, France and Germany, but sometimes sailed south into the Mediterranean Sea. Other Vikings moved to the east and then south along the rivers of Russia. Some even went as far as the area that is now the country of Turkey. In some places, the Vikings decided to say, many Vikings settled in England and in France and eventually they mixed with the local people. Other Vikings settled in Russia and also mixed with the people there. The most famous travels of the Vikings were in the Atlantic Ocean. Vikings sailed westward to the island of Iceland, where many of them stayed. Today the people of Iceland were descended from the Vikings. Some Vikings sailed further west to the cold island of Greenland. Vikings lived in Greenland for several generations, but eventually they died out. Some Vikings had gone even further west and reached the Canadian island of Newfoundland. The Vikings only stayed for a few years, but they had reached North America about 500 years before Christopher Columbus. Gradually the Vikings became converted to the Christian religion. They also stopped raiding the towns of Europe and instead of fighting, they began trading with their neighbors. Today the Scandinavian countries are known as very peace loving nations.",186.148625,136.02034395902734,Ideal

short-stories-0182-183-jazz.wav,"Jazz One of the most popular forms of music is known as jazz. Each year hundreds of thousands of people attend jazz concerts and festivals in cities around the world. Jazz music, both old and new, is played on the radio and on home stereos. Two of the most important features of jazz music are improvisation and syncopation. Music is created spontaneously by the musician during a performance. In other words, the musician modifies some existing music in a new and interesting way. Syncopation means that the regular patterns found in music may be broken up with new accents and uneven patterns being created. The features of improvisation and syncopation are difficult to use with skill and require great creativity on the part of the musician. Jazz music originated in the southern United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was based on African American music that was derived in part from rhythms in Western Africa. The earliest jazz musicians were influenced by a music style known as ragtime, which was popular during the late 19th century. Jazz music also incorporated some aspects of a related kind of music called the Blues. By the beginning of the 20th century, a fully developed form of jazz was being played in New Orleans, a city in the southern United States. Jazz musicians played instruments such as the trumpet, saxophone, cornette, and piano. Jazz soon became popular and was played on the riverboats that traveled along the Mississippi River. Some jazz musicians moved north to the city of Chicago and young musicians in that city developed some new forms of jazz music. By the 1920s and 1930s, jazz was popular in many parts of the United States, and some musicians began forming large bands, comprising many musicians, and many different instruments. This began the period known as the Big Bandera, when a popular form of jazz known as Swing Music was played. During the 1940s and 1950s, other forms of jazz known as Bob and Cool Jazz were developed. Some people preferred these newer kinds of jazz, but others preferred the older varieties. By the 1960s, some jazz musicians began to experiment with different kinds of musical instruments and with other kinds of music. Some musicians incorporated musical styles from other parts of the world, or combined jazz with rock music, and today some musicians have blended jazz with rap music. However, some people prefer the more traditional forms of jazz music. Of course, most of the great jazz musicians of the early 20th century, people such as Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie, and Billy Holiday aren't no longer alive. However, many great jazz musicians are still active, and many younger musicians have continued this form of music. People will continue to enjoy jazz music for a long time to come.",202.736375,140.28069703821032,Ideal

I listened carefully to the sounds of the jungle. I could hear strange animal noises and the leaves were rustling.

He grunted at someone who must have been in the distance. Then I felt the earth shake beneath my feet. I heard giant thumps on the ground as the floor of the jungle shook.

ielts-listening-0320-ielts-recent-actual-test-32-part-4.wav,"OK, and welcome back. During the short break we just took, several of you approach me with questions. So before going on with the orientation talk, I'd like to address those queries. As I found, if one person asks the question, probably a dozen others are wondering about the same thing. The first question is whether Wassermarter University employs modules technology as an instruction method. The answer is yes we do. At least that's what the university catalog says. If some of you don't understand what modules technology is, don't worry. I googled the word but couldn't find it. Apparently though, it's a method of broadband wireless access. At least that's what an American company's website told me. But again, don't worry. If you need to know something more, your professor can tell you. Another question someone asked me was what tomorrow's workshop on research methods and skills was about. Well, research skills include any method you can imagine for finding and presenting any information you need. That's not just schoolwork either. Writing English, the native language for most of you, and finding a job are also research skills. And yes, those will be addressed in tomorrow's workshop. As you know, Wassermarter University is one of this country's premier universities for the study of the Dismal Science Economics. Some of you it seems want to get a jump on their classmates. During the break half a dozen of you came up and asked me where to find economics' homes. I know it's odd, but this school's library holdings are divided up between two libraries. Economics books are in the old library. If you look out of the window behind me, you can see it. It's the red brick building. Oh, before I forget, you economics types also need a lot of math, am I right? Well, those math books are neither in the old library nor in the new one. They can be found in the math department building. Why am I telling you this? Doesn't the invisible hand guide economists? Maybe it's good you asked. In 2008, that hand shoved most of the world economy off a cliff, didn't it? Now, I realized that most of you couldn't bring a computer printer or a photocopier from home. So, I'm sure you're already wondering where you can copy things like term papers, internet articles, and things like that. I have some good news and some bad news. The good news is that there are a number of places you can make copies. These include both libraries and student union building. Now, the bad news. I'm sorry to say, most classroom buildings and academic departments do not have copies as students can use. So, most of the large buildings you see around campus do not have copies for students. The copies there are reserved for professors and office staff. Oh, yes, I nearly forgot to tell you. If you need to have printing done, all the copies available to students are laser printers. Plus, for your convenience, you compare using prepaid cards. You can get those in the student union building. That just covers the questions put to me. If you have more, please see me during the next break at 215. Right now, though, I'd like to start to give you a rundown on the various facilities here on campus. That way you won't get lost so easily in the weeks to come. I've been told that this year's incoming class features a large number of married students and parents. So, you must be wondering where to put the baby while you're in class. Okay, right now, we're in the student union building, right? Remember the big doors in front where you all came in? If you go out of the building, you can see the nursery is just on the other side of this building. It's only about 20 metres away. Convenient, eh? Next, we're all from different places around the country. Some of you are from other countries. That means we're pretty likely to get sick during the first months of school as we expose each other to many new viruses. So where's the doctor? Of course, you need to find the medical services centre, which is on the right as you leave the building. Remember, that's the second building on the right. And if you look out of that window, you can see a lot of antenna and satellite dishes on the roof. So that's what we call the media centre. Yeah, I know, I think it's confusing too. The media centre is next to the medical centre. The chairwoman of the journalism school on the first floor doesn't like it when people who wander in their mistake cover a nurse. Chances are, you'll have at least one math class while you're here. That red building there, just outside to the left, is the math department building. I know it looks about as old as the subject of math, but I assure you that the inside is equipped with state-of-the-art classroom equipment, including interactive chalkboards and surround sound in every room. Oh, can you see the back building there? Yes, behind the media centre. Quite new, isn't it? That's the new library, just decorated. They're back to back, you might say. If you look just to the left of it at the lower older looking building, you'll find the old library. It's nice and quiet. Perfect for those marathon study sessions during exam week.

Since the Twining link between our two towns, Stanthorpe here in England and Malat in France was established, the relationship between the towns has gone from strength to strength. Last month, 25 members of the Association from Stanthorpe spent a weekend in Malat. Our hosts had arranged a great program. We learned how cheese is produced in the region and had the chance to taste the product. The theme park trip had to be cancelled, but we all had a great time on the final boat trip down the river. That was the real highlight. This is a special year for the Association because it's 25 years since we were founded. In Malat, they're planning to mark this by building a footbridge in the municipal park. We've been discussing what to do here, and we've decided to plant a poplar tree in the museum gardens. We considered buying a garden seat to put there, but the authorities weren't happy with that idea. In terms of fundraising to support our activities, we've done very well. Our pancake evening was well attended and made record profits, and everyone enjoyed the demonstration of French cookery, which was nearly as successful.

ielts-listening-0160-cam10-test-4-part-4.wav,"Today we're going to look at an important area of science, namely nanotechnology. So, what is it? Nano means tiny, so it's science and engineering on the scale of atoms and molecules. The idea is that by controlling and rearranging atoms, you can literally create anything. However, as we'll see, the science of the small has some big implications affecting us in many ways. There's no doubt that nanotechnology promises so much for civilization. However, all new technologies have their teething problems. And with nanotechnology, society often gets the wrong idea about its capabilities. Numerous science fiction books and movies have raised people's fears about nanotechnology. With scenarios such as inserting little nanorobots into your body that monitor everything you do without you realizing it, or self-replicating nanorobots that eventually take over the world. So, how do we safeguard such a potentially powerful technology? Some scientists recommend that nanoparticles be treated as new chemicals, with separate safety tests and clear labeling. They believe that greater care should also be taken with nanoparticles in laboratories and factories. Others have called for a withdrawal of new nanoproducts such as cosmetics and a temporary hold to many kinds of nanotech research. But as far as I'm concerned, there's a need to plow ahead with the discoveries and applications of nanotechnology. I really believe that most scientists would welcome a way to guard against unethical uses of such technology. We can't go around thinking that all innovation is bad, all advancement is bad. As with the debate about any new technology, it is how you use it that's important. So, let's look at some of its possible uses. Thanks to nanotechnology, there could be a major breakthrough in the field of transportation, with the production of more durable metals. These could be virtually unbreakable, lighter, and much more pliable, leading to planes that are 50 times lighter than at present. Those same improved capabilities will dramatically reduce the cost of travelling into space, making it more accessible to ordinary people, and opening up a totally new holiday destination. In terms of technology, the computer industry will be able to shrink computer parts down to minute sizes. We need nanotechnology in order to create a new generation of computers that will work even faster and will have a million times more memory, but will be about the size of a sugar cube. Nanotechnology could also revolutionise the way that we generate power. The cost of solar cells will be drastically reduced, so harnessing this energy will be far more economical than at present. But nanotechnology has much wider applications than this, and could have an enormous impact on our environment. For instance, tiny airborne nanorobos could be programmed to actually rebuild the ozone layer, which could lessen the impact of global warming on our planet. That's a pretty amazing thought, isn't it? On a more local scale, this new technology could help with the cleanup of environmental disasters as nanotechnology will allow us to remove oil and other contaminants from the water far more effectively. And if nanotechnology progresses as expected, as a sort of building block set of about 90 atoms, then you could build anything you wanted from the bottom up. In terms of production, this means that you only use what you need, and so there wouldn't be any waste. The notion that you could create anything at all has major implications for our health. It means that we'll eventually be able to replicate anything. This would have a phenomenal effect on our society. In time, it could even lead to the eradication of famine through the introduction of machines that produce food to feed the hungry. But it's in the area of medicine that nanotechnology may have its biggest impact. How we detect disease will change as tiny biosensors are developed to analyse tests in minutes rather than days. There's even speculation nanorobots could be used to slow the aging process, lengthening life expectancy. As you can see, I'm very excited by the implications that could be available to us in the next few decades. Just how long it'll take, I honestly don't know.",324.4670625,128.14860059948302,Ideal

ielts-listening-0056-cam16-test-2-part-4.wav,"Dancing is something that humans do when they want to have a good time. It's a universal response to music found in all cultures. But what's only been discovered recently is that dancing not only makes us feel good, it's also extremely good for our health. Dancing, like other forms of exercise, releases hormones, such as dopamine, which make us feel relaxed and happy. And it also reduces feelings of stress or anxiety. Dancing is also a sociable activity, which is another reason it makes us feel good. One study compared people's enjoyment of dancing at home in front of a video with dancing in a group in a studio. The people dancing in a group reported feeling happier, whereas those dancing alone did not. In another experiment, university researchers at York and Sheffield took a group of students and sent each of them into a lab where music was played for five minutes. Each had to choose from three options. To sit and listen quietly to the music, to cycle on an exercise bike while they listened, or to get up and dance. All were given cognitive tasks to perform before and after. The result showed that those who chose to dance showed much more creativity when doing problem-solving tasks. Dr. Loveitt, at the University of Hartfordshire, believes dance could be a very useful way to help people suffering from mental health problems. He thinks dance should be prescribed as therapy to help people overcome issues such as depression. It's well established that dance is a good way of encouraging adolescent girls to take exercise, but what about older people? Studies have shown that there are enormous benefits for people in their 60s and beyond. One of the great things about dance is that there are no barriers to participation. Anyone can have a go. Even those who standard of fitness is quite low. Dance can be especially beneficial for older adults who can't run or do more intense workouts, or for those who don't want to. One 2015 study found that even a gentle dance workout helps to promote a healthy heart. And there's plenty of evidence which suggests that dancing lowers the risk of falls, which could result in a broken hip, for example, by helping people to improve their balance. There are some less obvious benefits of dance for older people too. One thing I hadn't realised before researching this topic was that dance isn't just a physical challenge. It also requires a lot of concentration, because you need to remember different steps and routines. For older people, this kind of activity is especially important, because it forces their brain to process things more quickly and to retain more information. Current research also shows that dance promotes a general sense of well-being in older participants, which can last up to a week after a class. Participants report feeling less tired and having greater motivation to be more active and do daily activities such as gardening or walking to the shops or a park. Ballroom or country dancing, both popular with older people, have to be done in groups. They require collaboration and often involve touching a dance partner, all of which encourages interaction on the dance floor. This helps to develop new relationships and can reduce older people's sense of isolation, which is a huge problem in many countries. I also looked at the benefits of Zumba. 15 million people in 180 countries now regularly take a Zumba class, an aerobic workout based on Latin American dance moves. John Paul Carrey, a professor of exercise and sports science at the University of Wisconsin, analyzed a group of women who was Zumba regulars and found that a class lasting 40 minutes burns about 370 calories. This is similar to moderately intense exercises like stepperobics or kickboxing. A study in the American Journal of Health Behavior showed that when women with obesity did Zumba three times a week for 16 weeks, they lost an average of 1.2 kilos and lowered their percentage of body fat by 1%. More importantly, the women enjoyed the class so much that they made it a habit and continued to attend classes at least once a week, very unusual for an aerobic exercise program. Dance is never going to compete with high intensity workouts when it comes to physical fitness gains, but its popularity is likely to keep on rising because it's such a fun way. It's a fun way to keep fit.",368.0039375,122.28130031896738,Ideal
ielts-listening-0012-cam19-test-3-part-4.wav,"In today's lecture I'm going to be talking about microplastics. Microplastics are tiny pieces of plastic smaller than 5mm in size. Recently, there's been a greater awareness that there are large quantities of plastic waste big and small in the environment. The amount of plastic waste in the oceans has received widespread attention, but far less is known about the effects of microplastics in freshwater and particularly in soil. Microplastics can enter the environment via a number of different sources. Threads and microfibers detach from synthetic clothing every time they're put in a washing machine and the ease find their way into the water system. Other sources include big pieces of plastic waste that are already in the environment and the ease break down into microscopic particles over a period of time. On a larger scale, factory waste is another route, as are tires which wear down as cars, lorries and so on travel along road surfaces. We already understand some of the impacts of microplastics from studies involving fish and other animals. There is evidence that microplastics harm small creatures in a variety of ways, such as by damaging their mouths or by impairing their ability to feed, for example when microplastics get lodged in their digestive system. Visingly perhaps it is likely that humans consume microplastics. As these have been detected in a wide range of food and drink products, including bottled water, as well as in water that comes direct from the tap. What's more, salt and many kinds of seafood have also been found to contain microplastics. However, it's important to underline that there is not yet conclusive proof that microplastics cause significant harm to people. In many countries, including here in the UK, there is legislation which prevents manufacturers from adding plastic microbeads to shower gels, facial cleansers and toothpaste. It is very difficult to accurately estimate the total amount of microplastic particles in the soil as they can be hard to detect. But we do know they are carried in the air and deposited in the soil by rain. What's more, many of the fertilizers used by both farmers and gardeners contain microplastics. A team from the Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge has carried out a study of the effects of microplastics on the digestive tracts of earthworms. These worms, which live in top soil, are an essential component of our agricultural system. By feeding on soil, they mix nutrients into it, thereby making it more fertile. The researchers set out to discover whether the introduction of microplastics into the soil and the subsequent ingestion of these by earthworms would impact soil quality and ultimately inhibit plant growth. The short answer was yes, it did. After placing three different types of microplastic particles into the soil, they planted perennial ryegrass. The particles of microplastic, which included biodegradable PLA and conventional high-density polyethylene or HTPE, were then ingested by the earthworms in the soil. The result was that the worms lost weight rapidly. What's more, a lower percentage than normal of the ryegrass seeds germinated, and the researchers concluded that this was a direct result of the earthworms being unable to fulfill their normal role in making soil more fertile. The team also discovered that there was an increase in the amount of acid found in the soil, and this was attributed mainly to the microplastic particles from conventional HTPE plastic. The conclusions of the study make for very interesting reading. I've included the reference in the notes to give you at the end of this session. To summarize, the authors proposed the idea that we need to regard soil as we would regard any other process in nature. This means we should accept the implications of soil being dependent on decaying and dead matter constantly being passed through the bodies of earthworms. It is when soil becomes impoverished by the presence of microplastics, not only ecosystems, but also the whole of society are negatively impacted.",307.672375,128.9033505201759,Ideal

short-stories-0243-246-canadian-colleges-and-universities.wav,"Canadian colleges and universities. Canada has about 50 accredited universities spread across 10 provinces. All except one are primarily government funded. This means that there is considerable uniformity regarding programs, administration and policy. Private colleges tend to be smaller and are mostly based on a religious curriculum. Most universities offer programs in the humanities, social sciences and pure sciences. Many have additional faculties such as education and physical education. Many programs that lead directly to a position in the workplace are given at community colleges. Community colleges differ from universities because their programs involve job training and practical experience. For example, they might offer courses in areas such as computer programming, journalism, photography, social work, dentistry and nursing. Their programs are considered to be less abstract and academic than university programs. Many students see university as being more fun than community college. They don't have to worry immediately about getting a job and the social life is often better at university. However, a university degree may be less likely to lead directly to a job. Nowadays, university programs which are work related, such as business administration, education, child studies and psychology, seem especially popular. Universities, however, were founded mainly as liberal arts institutions. This means that their original intent was to prepare people to be well-rounded human beings and knowledgeable citizens. So nearly all universities have programs in literature, languages, philosophy, culture, music, history and politics, as well as studies that are more job related. A past BA or BSC degree in Canada is normally three full years of study after secondary school. A bachelor degree with honors includes one more year of study. A master's degree is a further one or two years. A doctorate usually requires four or more years. This is similar to the United States, except that their bachelor degree is normally three years and their master's degree may be up to three years. To gain entrance to university, you usually need to graduate from secondary school with a B average. Some programs will require an A average. Tuition costs have gone up in recent years as governments have handed over less money to colleges and universities. More students now have to work during the school year to pay their expenses. Attending college and university is known to be one of the most carefree periods in a person's life.

short-stories-0199-200-charles-dickens.wav,"Charles Dickens Charles Dickens is considered one of the greatest writers in the history of English literature. Dickens wrote his many novels during the 19th century, but those novels remained popular even today. Literary experts admire his genius at describing the lives and personalities of the many characters in his books. Charles Dickens was born in England in 1812. His father was a clerk who worked for the Navy. Unfortunately, his father was not good at managing money, and the family soon went deeply into debt. In those days, people who owed money were sent to prison, and their families were sent to places called workhouses. When Charles's father was unable to pay the debts, Charles was sent to a workhouse where he had to work long hours, and Charles's father was sent to prison. After a few years, the family regained its freedom, but the experience had a lasting effect upon Charles. As a young man, Charles Dickens worked as a journalist in the law courts and in parliament, but he soon began writing stories for newspapers. These stories were very popular with the readers. Soon Dickens began writing entire novels for the newspapers. Each month, the newspaper would publish another chapter of Dickens' latest novel. One of Dickens' most famous early novels is called Oliver Twist. This is the story of a young man who is poor and alone in the city of London and becomes involved in criminal activities to support himself. The characters in this novel have a very wide range of personalities, but seem very real to the reader. The book exposed the conditions that face the poor people of London and helped to encourage reforms aimed at improving those conditions. Perhaps Dickens' most popular novel is a Christmas Carol. In this story, a rich but stingy old man, Ebenezer Scrooge refuses to give his employee a day off at Christmas and refuses to donate money to help the poor. But while sleeping, Scrooge is visited by ghosts from his past, present, and future. These ghosts show Scrooge how badly he has behaved. When Scrooge wakes up, he becomes a kind and generous man who fully appreciates the spirit of the Christmas holiday. Another famous novel of Dickens is A Tale of Two Cities. This is a story of the violence and upheaval during the French Revolution. The story is famous for the heroic act of sacrifice that is made by one character for the benefit of the others. Dickens was famous as a public speaker and large crowds assembled to hear his performances. When he died in 1870, he was a very famous man. The novels of Charles Dickens allow the reader to experience the life of 19th century London, showing the poverty and injustice that were so common. The characters of these novels show the range of human behavior from cruelty and selfishness to kindness and love. It is no surprise that Dickens is viewed as one of the great figures of English literature.",211.9053125,141.8558111892546,Ideal

War, persecution, and economic depression affect not only adults, but also old people, children, babies, the sick, and the handicapped. Since history is written mostly about politicians, soldiers, intellectuals, and criminals, we don't read very often about how events affect ordinary people. Now and then a special book will shed light on what it was like to live in the midst of terrible events. Such a book is the diary of Anne Frank. Anne Frank was born in Frankfurt, Anne Main, Germany in 1929. Her father Otto Frank was a businessman who moved the family to the Netherlands in 1934. In Amsterdam, Otto started a company selling pectin to make jams and jellies. Later he began a second company that sold herbs for seasoning meat. Otto Frank had decided to leave Germany because of the policies and personality of the new German Chancellor Adolf Hitler. Hitler had a personal hatred, not only for Jewish people, but also for everything Jewish. He felt that one way to strengthen Germany and solve its problems was to kill or drive out all the Jews. Hitler also felt that other groups such as blacks, gypsies, the handicapped, homosexuals, and a chronically unemployed should be eliminated, then only strong healthy, true Germans would be left. Since Hitler had a plan to solve Germany's economic problems, he received a lot of popular support. Very few Germans realized that he was mentally and emotionally unbalanced and would kill anyone who got in his way. The Frank family was Jewish and they felt that they would be safe in the Netherlands. However, in May 1940, Germany invaded the Netherlands and soon took over the government. In 1941, laws were passed to keep Jews separate from other Dutch citizens. The following year, Dutch Jews began to be shipped to concentration camps in Germany and Poland. Just before this began, and Frank, Otto's younger daughter, received a diary for her 13th birthday, less than a month later, the whole family went into hiding. Otto Frank had made friends with the Dutch people, who worked with them in his business operations. Now these friends were ready to help him, even though hiding Jews from the authorities was treated as a serious crime. Behind Otto Frank's business offices, there was another house that was not visible from the street. Here the Franks moved many other things. Only a few trusted people knew they were living there. The Franks moved into these small rooms on July 6, 1942, and they lived there with another Jewish family, the Van Pals. Until the police captured them on August 4, 1944. So for more than two years, the two families never went outside. All their food and supplies had to be brought to them. During this period, Anne Frank told her diary, all of her thoughts and fears. Like any teenage girl, she hoped that good things would happen to her, that she would become a writer or a movie star. She complained that her parents treated her like a child. She insisted that she was grown up. She also talked about how difficult it was to live in a small area with seven other people and not to be able to go outside. She wrote about the war, and hoped the Netherlands would soon be liberated from the Germans. And sometimes, Anne beat her older sister Margot, who was so much more mature, and who never got into trouble. She and Margot wrote letters to each other to pass the time, and even had a romance with Peter Van Pals who was 17. Then all their fears came true. All the eight Jews hiding in the house for arrested and eventually sent to Oswitch, death camp in Poland. Although the war was ending, it did not end soon enough for the Frank family. Only Otto Frank survived the war. One of their helpers, Miop Geese, saved Anne's diary and kept it. After the war, Otto Frank decided to publish it. Since 1947, more than 20 million copies had been sold in 55 languages.

You would see so many things as you flew over rooftops and forests. You would feel incredibly free as you traveled from place to place, not bothered by road signs or traffic jams. If I could fly like a bird, I would start from my backyard and travel through town. I would look down on the houses and factories. When I got tired, I would land in a field and take a nap. I would travel above rivers and follow them as they wound along and emptied into lakes and oceans. I would fly above parks and I would call out to the children as I flew high above them. I would dip and dive as I flew. I would soar up high and dive down low. So that I could almost touch the treetops. Have you ever flown? I know that you can't fly like a bird, but you might have taken an airplane ride. When you're in an airplane, you pass through clouds. It is exciting to take an airplane ride. I love taking airplane flights. I like to look down at the earth. When you're up that high, everything below you looks tiny. That's the closest I'll get to flying like a bird.

short-stories-0172-173-the-history-of-the-english-language.wav,"The History of the English Language Most people know that the English language is spoken by millions of people around the world. However, few people are aware of the history of the English language. Today, English is one language, but in some ways it's a mixture of many different languages. The English language is most closely related to a group of languages called the Germanic languages. This group also includes languages such as German and Dutch. About 1500 years ago, these languages were not yet distinct from each other. Some of the people of Germany and the Netherlands then moved to England. Those people were called the Anglo-Saxons, and their language then evolved into English. Most of the basic words of the English language are derived from these very old Anglo-Saxon languages. For example, words for the parts of the body, for numbers, and for animals are mostly Anglo-Saxon words. Some new words were brought to England over 1,000 years ago by people who came from the Scandinavian countries of Northern Europe. Many words that begin with the letters SK, such as skin and skill, are Scandinavian words. A major change happened in the English language after the year 1066. In that year, England was conquered by a king from the northern part of France. He and his followers spoke French, so French became an important language in England. During the next few hundred years, the English language absorbed a very large number of French words. In fact, today's English dictionaries contain more words of French origin than of Anglo-Saxon origin. Part of the reason why the English language has so many words is that it often has two words for each idea. One word of Anglo-Saxon origin, and one word of French origin. Many more words entered the English language a few hundred years ago when science and technology became more widespread. Most scientific and technical words are derived from words of the ancient languages of Latin and Greek. Because there are so many of these scientific and technical words in the English language today, the influence of Latin and Greek has been quite large. Other languages have also contributed many words to the English language. Some words have come from the Celtic languages spoken in Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. Many words have been added to the English language by immigrants who came to North America from various countries of Europe. Also, many more words have been adopted from the native languages of North America, Australia, and the Pacific, and from the languages of the peoples of Africa and Asia. All of these words have made English a very interesting language.",170.449,155.58906183081154,Fast

short-stories-0218-220-come-to-the-fair.wav,"Come to the Fair. Fall fairs have been a feature of North American life since early in the 19th century. At the end of the harvest, people from rural areas have come together to celebrate. Usually, these fairs take the form of a competition regarding the best of all farm products of that year. Depending on the part of the country and its most important crop, fall fairs can begin as early as August or as late as November. They usually last several days. When the United States and Canada were organized, they were divided into small units called counties. Larger units were called states or provinces. Many of the best known fairs are county fairs or state fairs. There are also smaller local fairs and larger ones too, like the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto, Ontario. Since these fairs are usually annual events, many have developed permanent buildings over the years. Most of these are large barn-like structures. These buildings are used to display new products for farm life, such as tractors, home furnishings, and water systems. Several barns are usually necessary to house all the horses, cows, pigs, goats, sheep, chickens, and other animals in competition. There must also be room to display all the vegetables, berries, and fruits in competition. Finally, there is space for handicrafts, artwork, baked goods, and jams and jellies. Usually there is a grandstand, which is a stage with wooden seats around it. Here entertainers perform for an audience during the fair. Country and western singers are usually popular at fairs, but so are comedians, clowns, dancers, and musicians. There may also be other contests, such as a beauty competition for queen of the fair, tests of strength for the men, or pie-eating events. Most fairs also have a racetrack, which is used for horse racing, or in some cases, auto-racing. Fairs have helped to improve animal breeds and races encourage the breeding of fast horses. Plowing contests test the strength and steadiness of horses, and so do pulling contests. This spirit of competition has led to improvements in all areas of farming. Every kind of grain, fruit, vegetable, berry, and animal is tested, and only the best win a ribbon. This encourages fairness to improve their products. Farm women compete to produce the best homemade food and crafts. Many kinds of fruit and vegetables are stored in glass jars for the winter. The best of these also receive prizes. Most fairs have a dining area where there is good food served to the public. The goal of improving farming is sponsored by the governments of Canada and the USA. Four H clubs are youth organizations that encourage farm children to take an interest in farming. Four H clubs aim at improving the heads, hearts, hands, and health of their members. There are also women's organizations, such as the Women's Institutes in Canada, which work to make the life of farm families better. Fall fairs have taken over the idea of the midway from the circus. The midway has rides like ferris wheels, marigold rounds, and roller coasters. It also has games of chance and skill, such as trying to throw a small hoop over a large bottle. One nice thing about fall fairs is that they are fun for the whole family. Women enjoy the midway and the farm animals, women like the crafts, food, and household exhibits, men like the machinery, the horse races, and the crop exhibits. Everyone likes the grandstand shows. Nowadays not so many people live on farms, but people from towns and cities still enjoy going to fall fairs. They are part of our North American heritage.",250.906125,145.8712895111668,Ideal
ielts-listening-0294-ielts-recent-actual-test-6-part-2.wav,"Hello everyone. Now you know why I'm here. You all work in a factory and in this environment there always remains a significant possibility of accidents happening. In which case first aid will be necessary. What is first aid? It is the provision of emergency on-site care when an injury occurs. And it is essential for everyone to know if only simply the steps which must be followed. There are of course minor injuries which may happen, not needing further medical care beyond the intervention of the first aid. But you can never be sure, thus the following steps must always be followed. These can be abbreviated to the words Dr. A B C. In other words, D R A B C. The D stands for danger and that's the first issue to keep in mind. When an accident happens immediately ascertain that the environment is safe. That for example nothing else will fall or break or cause accidents. If you the first aid are also injured the problem is even worse. The R stands for respond. You must then ascertain the best response. Once all the danger has been eliminated and the distress calls sent out. The appropriate action is obviously to help the injured party. Alright that leads to A which stands for airway. In order to stay alive all people need to have an open airway to allow breathing. A conscious person will automatically clear their own airway. But if unconscious this may not happen. The brain is stopped or hindered from properly directing the body and obviously in the worst case death can result. For this reason the injured person is normally put into the recovery position. Placed on the side, tilting the head back and ensuring that there are no blockages in the mouth. To free any such blockages the back can be slapped or the chest compressed allowing anything to be spat out. Now that the airway is free check for B or breathing. If breathing is not happening or is irregular the first aid are may have to assist with what is technically known as cardiopulmonary resuscitation or more commonly CPR. This involves breathing for the patient through mouth to mouth contact. While periodically massaging the heart through compressions to the chest. This combination allows blood and oxygen to flow around the body. Keeping the patient alive. Hopefully until medics such as doctors, advanced first aiders or ambulance staff arrive. Now it's certainly good to have knowledge of emergency first aid but obviously the best situation is simply not to have accidents occur in the first place. For that you need to be aware of safety issues but just saying be aware does not usually achieve much. It is more important to have an appointed person whose job is to ensure awareness and work safety. Safety inspections would obviously be part of their job. Whereby they can make sure for example that the first aid boxes are fully equipped. Another idea is to put posters on the walls but interestingly research has proven that these tend to be ignored becoming just part of the wallpaper. Seen but not put into practice. It is much better if everyone is just instilled to not be reckless. That is to not rush into situations without thinking about the possibility of accidents. And instilling this mindset is part of the job of the safety officer. Some other suggestions are ongoing first aid training and no accident reward or star systems. These have had some success but nothing beats a regular meeting say once a month in which the subject of safety is brought to the attention of everyone and any outstanding issues related to this are thoroughly discussed.",257.4485625,144.72793958599013,Ideal
short-stories-0246-249-favorite-cookies.wav,"Favorite Cookies North Americans are known for their sweet tooth. This means that they like snacks with lots of sugar. Americans drink a lot of coffee, tea, and hot chocolate, and usually they have something sweet with their drink. Cookies are one of America's favorite desserts. The word cookie comes from a Dutch word, meaning little cake. People from Europe brought their favorite recipes with them when they came to America. The English brought their custom of having tea in the afternoon. Usually with their tea they would have cakes or biscuits. Biscuits are usually hard wafers, like for example ginger snaps. In fact the Italian slang word for Englishman is cake eater. In the early days all cookies were homemade, but in the late 19th century biscuits began to be manufactured in large quantities by machine. In 1912 the National Biscuit Company, Nabisco in the USA, introduced Oreo cookies. This cookie has a rich cream vanilla filling between two crispy chocolate wafers. This product was designed to meet the demand for an English-style biscuit. Oreos were good to dunk in a drink, to eat whole, to eat in parts, or to use in cooking. Oreos have become both Americas and the world's favorite commercial cookie. New varieties of Oreos are added regularly to the original product. Although commercial biscuits like Oreos are very popular, many people prefer home-baked ones. In fact there is a whole line of commercial cookies called home-style, which try to imitate homemade cookies. The most popular cookie in America can be either bought in a package or baked at home. These are chocolate chip cookies. Ruth and Kenneth Wakefield operated the toll house in and Whitman, Massachusetts. One day, in 1930 Mrs. Wakefield ran out of baking chocolate for her baking cookies. She broke up a chocolate bar and added the pieces to her cookie mix. She expected that the chocolate bits would melt into the dough when she'd bake them, but they didn't. As soon, chocolate chip cookies were being made commercially by adding small chunks of chocolate to regular chocolate cookie dough. Lots of people like to make their own by adding commercial chocolate chips to their dough. Now, chocolate chip cookies are the most popular kind of cookie in North America. Over 7 billion are eaten annually here. Half of all the cookies baked in American homes are chocolate chip cookies. Packs in baking and packaging have led to new kinds of cookies. Recently, soft cookies have become very popular. Since they are packaged in foil, they can stay fresh and soft for many months. It seems likely that the love of cookies will be around for a long time.",189.622875,141.7550493314691,Ideal

ielts-listening-0234-cam5-test-3-part-2.wav,"As I said earlier, there is, I think, at Rexford an excellent combination of physical and geographical advantages, as well as having a rural setting and still being close to central London, something that will certainly be of interest to you is that Rexford is just 35 minutes from London airport. At Rexford we have a strong research capability. We came 7th out of 101 universities in last year's research assessment, carried out by a government body, and did particularly well in your particular subjects, engineering and science. Actually, we got a top research grade of 5 for engineering, geography and computer sciences. One further point, and I know from talking to you individually, that a number of you may be looking for some experience in industry after the course, is that all our science and engineering research departments have unusually close relationships with industry in the area. Anyway, that's enough sales talk from me. I'll just take a sip of this coffee that's just arrived. Thank you. And then I'll say something about what actually happens when you apply. Right. Now if you do decide to make an application, what you do is send it directly to me in my department. I will then immediately send confirmation and the application process begins. And I'd like to say at this point that you shouldn't worry if this process doesn't work all that quickly. I mean, occasionally there are postal problems, but most often the hold-up is caused by references. The people you give us referees, shall we say, take their time to reply. Anyway, it's absolutely normal for this process to take three to four months. What I do in this period is keep in touch with you and reassure you that things are moving along. One of the ways we've devised to help you decide about applying, as well as later when you've been accepted, hopefully, is to put you in contact with, if possible, a student from your own country who is at present studying with us. What you can do is phone them up, we will of course liais between you, and discuss your concerns with them. That way you can get an objective opinion of what you can expect if you come to live and study at Rexford. Not only the academic atmosphere, but important details like what the leisure facilities are like, and whether the English weather and food are really as awful as everybody says. If you decide you can face it, the contact can also help you just before you leave with tips on what to pack and that sort of thing. At the moment I think we've got two second year students and one postgraduate from this country. Now to move on to the other concerns you expressed earlier. At a UK university, as I'm sure you know, you will be in an environment where independent learning is the norm, which takes most students a while to adjust to. And at a time when you will be separated from your normal surroundings, and in most cases your family. This can be a difficult time. But remember that something like 25% of our student body are international students like yourselves, and that there are several organisations in the university and city whose main purpose is to offer help and ensure that your time with us is enjoyable and useful. One or two of you touched on the subject of accommodation earlier, so I'll just add a few points. It is the university's policy to give priority in the allocation of residence places to three categories. And those are visiting students, exchange students, and new postgraduate students. However, demand exceeds supply, so there is still a need to put your name down early for campus accommodation, particularly if your family is accompanying you. This means that the earlier you decide whether you want to study with us, and so get the procedure moving, the better it will be for everybody. Yes. What if you would prefer to live outside the university? If you're planning to live off campus, you've got to sort things out even earlier. As with everything in short supply, the good accommodation gets snapped up months before the beginning of term. In other words, if you're starting in October, you need to be thinking about it in June, or at the very latest July. So you do need to think very carefully about what you need, how much you can afford to pay well in advance. What you can't do is leave it until a few days before the start of term. The agencies in town are pretty good, it's just a matter of contacting them in good time. Of course, we have a full-time accommodation officer available to help all students. She'll get in touch with you when you're accepted. She's got plenty of contacts in the town, and will deal with the agencies on your behalf. One or two of you asked me earlier about your level of spoken English. Obviously, most of you have already achieved a lot. I wish I could speak your language half as well. Having said that though, I'm afraid the lecturers will make little or no allowance for the presence of non-native speakers in the audience. So anything you can do to improve your spoken English, even beyond the pretty high levels most of you have already reached, will help make your stay with us that bit more fun for you. Some extra practice before you arrive is worth more than, for example, private lessons afterwards when you won't really have time.

ielts-listening-0106-cam13-test-3-part-2.wav,"So, if you're one of those people who hasn't found the perfect physical activity yet, here are some things to think about which might help you make the right decision for you. The first question to ask yourself is whether you would enjoy training in a gym. Many people are put off by the idea of having to fit a visit to the gym into their busy day. You often have to go very early or late, as some gyms can get very crowded. But with regular training, you'll see a big difference in a relatively short space of time. Running has become incredibly popular in recent years. That's probably got a lot to do with the fact that it's a very accessible form of exercise that anyone can run, even if you can only run a few metres to begin with. But make sure you get the right shoes. It's worth investing in a high quality pair and they don't come cheap. Another great thing about running is that you can do it at any time of day or night. The only thing that may stop you is snow and ice. Swimming is another really good way to build fitness. What attracts many people is that you can swim in an indoor pool at any time of year. On the other hand, it can be quite boring or solitary. It's hard to chat to people while you're swimming lengths. Cycling has become almost as popular as running in recent years. That's probably because as well as improving their fitness. Many people say being out in the fresh air in a park or in the countryside can be fun. Provided the conditions are right, of course, only fanatics go out in the wind and rain. Yoga is a good choice for those of you looking for exercise which focuses on developing both a healthy mind and body. It's a good way of building strength and with the right instructor there's less chance of hurting yourself than with other more active sports. But don't expect to find it easy. It can be surprisingly challenging, especially for people who aren't very flexible. Getting a personal trainer is a good way to start your fitness program. Obviously there can be significant costs involved, but if you've got someone there to encourage you and help you achieve your goals, you're less likely to give up. Make sure you get someone with a recognized qualification though, or you could do yourself permanent damage. Whatever you do, don't join a gym unless you're sure you'll make good use of it. So many people waste lots of money by signing up for membership and then hardly ever go. What happens to their good intentions? I don't think people suddenly stop caring about improving their fitness or decide they have more important things to do. I think people lose interest when they don't think they're making enough progress. That's when they give up hope and stop believing they'll ever achieve their goals. Also what people sometimes don't realize when they start is that it takes a lot of determination and hard work to keep training week after week and lots of people don't have that kind of commitment. One thing you can do to help yourself is to set manageable goals, be realistic and don't push yourself too far. Some people advise writing goals down, but I think it's better to have a flexible approach. Give yourself a really nice treat every time you reach one of your goals. And don't get too upset if you experience setbacks. It's a journey. There are bound to be difficulties along the way.",245.658625,149.47572062654018,Ideal
ielts-listening-0028-cam18-test-3-part-4.wav,"In today's astronomy lecture, I'm going to talk about the need for a system to manage the movement of satellites and other objects in orbit around the Earth. In other words, a space traffic management system. We already have effective air traffic control systems that are used internationally to ensure that planes navigate our skies safely. Well, space traffic management is a similar concept, but focusing on the control of satellites. The aim of such a system would be to prevent the danger of collisions in space between the objects in orbit around the Earth. In order to do this, we'd need to have a set of legal measures, and we'd also have to develop the technical systems to enable us to prevent such accidents. But unfortunately, at present, we don't actually have a space traffic management system that works. So, why not? What are the problems in developing such a system? Well, for one thing, satellites are relatively cheap these days, compared with how they were in the past, meaning that more people can afford to put them into space. So, there's a lot more of them out there, and people aren't just launching single satellites, but whole constellations, consisting of thousands of them designed to work together. So, space is getting more crowded every day. But in spite of this, one thing you may be surprised to learn is that you can launch a satellite into space, and once it's out there, it doesn't have to send back any information to Earth to allow its identification. So, while we have international systems for ensuring we know where the planes in our skies are, and to prevent them from colliding with one another, when it comes to the safety of satellites, at present we don't have anything like enough proper ways of tracking them. And it isn't just entire satellites that we need to consider. A greater threat is the huge amount of space debris in orbit around the Earth, broken bits of satellite, and junk from space stations and so on. And some of these are so small that they can be very hard to identify, but they can still be very dangerous. In addition, some operators may be unwilling to share information about the satellites they've launched. For example, a satellite may be designed for military purposes, or it may have been launched for commercial reasons, and the operators don't want competitors to have information about it. And even if the operators are willing to provide it, the information isn't easy to collect. The operators are needed about the object itself, as well as about its location at a particular time. And remember that a satellite isn't very big, and it's likely to be moving at thousands of kilometres an hour. We don't have any sensors that can constantly follow something moving so fast, so all that the scientists can do is to put forward a prediction concerning where the satellite is heading next. So those are some of the problems that we're facing. Let's consider now some of the solutions that have been suggested. One key issue is the way in which information is dealt with. We need more information, but it also needs to be accessible at a global level, so we need to establish shared standards that we can all agree on, for the way in which this information is presented. We already do this in other areas of science, so although this is a challenge, it's not an impossible task. Then as all this information is collected, it needs to be put together so it can be used, and that will involve creating a single database on which it can be entered. As we continue to push forward new developments, congestion of the space environment is only going to increase. To cope with this, we need to develop a system like the one I've described to coordinate the work of the numerous spacecraft operators. But it's also essential that this system is one that establishes trust in the people that use it, both nationally and at a global level. One interesting development that I'll mention at the moment.",296.8426875,140.47844786474653,Ideal

ielts-listening-0208-cam7-test-4-part-4.wav,"In today's lecture, I'm going to talk about monosodium glutamate, or MSG, as it's more commonly known. Now, MSG, as you probably know, is a flavor enhancer, which is used particularly in Chinese and Japanese cooking. Today, I'm going to explore why it is so popular in these cuisines, and more importantly, how does it enhance the flavor of food? The main reason why MSG is more commonly used in Japanese meals is tradition. For many thousands of years, the Japanese have incorporated a type of seaweed, known as kombu in their cooking. As they discovered, it had the ability to make food taste better. But it wasn't until 1908 that the ingredient in kombu, which was responsible for the improvement in flavor, was actually discovered to be glutamate by scientists working there. From 1908 until 1956, glutamate was produced commercially in Japan by a very slow and expensive means of extraction. It was in 1956 that the speed of the process was improved and industrial production increased dramatically and still continues to increase to this day. In fact, hundreds of thousands of tons of MSG are produced all over the world today. So what exactly is MSG? Well, monosodium glutamate contains 78.2 percent glutamate, 12.2 percent sodium, and 9.6 percent water. Glutamate is an amino acid that can be found naturally in all protein-containing foods. So this includes foods such as meat and cheese. It is widely known that Chinese and Japanese food contains MSG, but many people don't seem to be aware that it is also used in foods and other parts of the world. For example, it is found in commercially made Italian pizzas in American fast food and in Britain, MSG is used in things like potato crisps. So how exactly does MSG work? Well in the Western world, we commonly talk of four tastes, and I'm sure you're all familiar with the concepts of sweet, sour, bitter, and salt. Well, in 1908, Kikunate Ikeda identified a fifth taste, and it is thought that MSG intensifies this naturally occurring taste in some food. It does make perfect evolutionary sense that we should have the ability to detect or taste glutamate because it is the amino acid which is most common in natural foods. John Prescott, an associate professor at the University of Chicago, suggests that this fifth taste serves a purpose just as the other tastes do. He suggests that it signals to us the presence of protein in food, in the same way that sweetness indicates that a food contains energy-giving carbohydrates. Bitterness, he says, alerts us to toxins in the food, while sourness warns us of spoilage and saltiness signals the presence of minerals. So what else do we know about this fifth taste?",219.9150625,125.5029995955825,Ideal
ielts-listening-0206-cam7-test-4-part-2.wav,"Welcome to all of you. Can everybody see and hear me? Good. I'm Sally, your guide for this tour of the bicentennial park. I hope that you're all wearing your most comfortable shoes and that you can keep up the pace. So let's get underway on our tour around this wonderful park. I'll start today with some general background information. There used to be a lot of factories in this area until the 1960s. Creating the park required the demolition of lots of derelict buildings on the site. So most of the exciting park space all around you was originally warehouses and storehouses. The idea of building a public park here was first discussed when a property developer proposed a high-rise housing development, but the local community wasn't happy. If the land was to be cleaned up, they wanted to use the site for recreation. Residents wanted open space for outdoor activities rather than housing or even an indoor sports complex. Now to the bicentennial park itself, it has two areas, a nature reserve and a formal park with man-made features and gardens. The tall blue and white building in front of us is called the Tower and is the centre point for the formal gardens. It stands 12 metres high, so follow me up the stairs to where we can take advantage of the fantastic views. Well, here we are at the top of the tower and we're going to look at the view from each direction. Out to the east, the large buildings about a kilometre away are on the Olympic site. There's an indoor arena for gymnastics, a stadium for track and field and a swimming pool for racers and synchronised swimming and also diving. If you look carefully down there, you can see the train lines. The Olympic site has its own station to encourage the use of public transport. There is also a car park but it only holds a limited number of cars. The formal park has some specially created water features. If you look out here to the south, you can see a circular ornamental pond. And around to the west, you can relax and sit on a bench to smell the flowers and the rose garden. And finally up to the north, if you look in front of you now, there's a lake with a small island in the centre. You can hire rowing boats at the boat shed, which you can't see from here. But if you look through the trees, you can see the cafe, which has lovely views across the water. Okay, let's climb down now. We will go now and have a look at the nature reserve section of the park, which has opened up natural wetland to the public. The mangroves have been made more accessible to visitors by the boardwalk built during the park's upgrade. You'd think that people would come here to look at the unusual plant life of the area, but in fact it's more often used for cycling and is very popular with the local clubs. This is the far end of the park and over there you can see the frog pond, a natural feature here long before the park was designed. Just next to it we have our outdoor classroom, a favourite spot for school parties. The area is now most often used by primary schools for biology lessons. And finally, let's pass by the Waterbird Refuge. This area is in a sheltered part of the history. That's why the park's viewing shelter is a favourite spot for birdwatchers who can use it to spy through binoculars. You can watch a variety of waterbirds, but most visitors expect to see black swans when they come to the shelter. You might spot one yourself right now. Well, here we are back at our starting point, the visitors.",241.7316875,160.0948572371175,Fast

I have changed. I have become less shy. I have learned that making friends is easy to do. All you have to do is say hello. Most people will respond to a smile and a friendly hello. People will begin to talk to you about little things in their lives. You will soon realize that you have something in common with that person. Whenever I start talking to a new person, I find that there is some interest that we share. Maybe we know some of the same people, or we went to the same school. Often we find that we like the same music, or the same movies. It is easy to have a conversation with someone once you find a topic that you can both relate to. The most important part in making friends is to listen to what the other person says. If you take an interest in them, they are sure to take an interest in you. I have learned many things from meeting people. I have had many fascinating conversations, and I have made a lot of good friends. One day a girl came up to me and said that she was lost. She couldn't find her way to her English class. I said that I was going to that class too. I told her to come with me. We began talking, and we became very good friends. That was a few years ago.

ielts-listening-0058-cam16-test-3-part-2.wav,"Hello everyone, my name's Megan Baker and I'm a recruitment consultant at AVT recruitment specialists. Now our company specialises in positions that involve working in the agriculture and horticulture sectors, so that's fresh food production, garden and park maintenance and so on. And these sectors do provide some very special career opportunities. For a start, they often offer opportunities for those who don't want to be stuck with a 40-hour week, but need to juggle work with other responsibilities, such as childcare. And this is very important for many of our recruits. Some people like working in a rural setting, surrounded by plants and trees instead of buildings, although we can't guarantee that. But there are certainly health benefits, especially in jobs where you're not sitting all day looking at a screen, a big plus for many people. Salaries can sometimes be good too, although there's a lot of variety here. And you may have the opportunity in some types of jobs for travel overseas, although that obviously depends on the job, and not everyone is keen to do it. Of course, working outdoors does have its challenges. It's fine in summer, but can be extremely unpleasant when it's cold and windy. You may need to be pretty fit for some jobs, though with modern technology, that's not as important as it once was. And standards of health and safety are much higher now than they used to be, so there are fewer work-related accidents. But if you like a lively city environment, surrounded by lots of people, these jobs are probably not for you. They're often in pretty remote areas. And some people worry about finding a suitable place to live, but in our experience, this usually turns out fine. Now, let me tell you about some of the exciting jobs that we have on our books right now. One is for a fresh food commercial manager. Our client here is a very large fresh food producer, supplying a range of top supermarkets. They operate in a very fast-paced environment with low profit margins. The staff there work hard, but they play hard as well, so if you have a sociable personality, this may be for you. We have an exciting post as an agronomist, advising farmers on issues such as crop nutrition, protection against pests, and the latest legislation on farming and agricultural practices. There are good opportunities for the right person to quickly make their way up the career ladder, but a deep knowledge of the agricultural sector is expected of applicants. A leading supermarket is looking for a fresh produce buyer who is available for a 12-month maternity cover contract. You need to have experience in administration, planning and buying in the fresh produce industry, and in return, will receive a very competitive salary. We have also received a request for a sales manager for a chain of garden centres. You will be visiting centres in the region to ensure their high levels of customer service are maintained. This post is only suitable for someone who is prepared to live in the region. There is also a vacancy for a tree technician to carry out tree cutting, forestry and conservation work. Candidates must have a clean driving licence and have training in safety procedures. A year's experience would be preferred, but the company might be prepared to consider someone who has just completed an appropriate training course. Finally, we have a position for a farm worker. This will involve a wide range of farm duties, including crop sewing and harvesting, machine maintenance and animal care. Perks of the job include the possibility of renting a small cottage on the estate and a chance to earn a competitive salary. A driving licence and tractor driving experience are essential.",278.36825,136.0068901536005,Ideal
short-stories-0265-268-gambling.wav,"Gambling. Many governments have turned to legalized gambling as a way to increase revenues. Raising taxes has become very unpopular and gambling can be seen as a cash cow. Large casinos are often considered good for areas with high unemployment. Most new casinos include a variety of slot machines, table games such as Blackjack and roulette wheels. Opponents of gambling point to problems associated with it. Crime rates go up, especially with respect to theft and prostitution. People become addicted to gambling and play until they are broke. Stress is put on families when one member gambles and the grocery and rent money are spent. On the other hand, many people view gambling as an exciting form of entertainment. They look forward to the opportunity to play the lottery or go to the casino. Often they feel that they are getting good value in terms of entertainment for what they spend. The truth is probably that some people can control the urge to gamble while some cannot. People who find gambling really exciting feel that they have to go back for that high, even if it means spending all their money. Many people doubt that government should promote gambling since it is certain to produce addicts. There has also been some question whether gambling is good for the local economy. If a casino is built in an area of high unemployment, will local people really benefit? The answer seems to be both yes and no. People may benefit if the gamblers come in large numbers from outside the area and spend their money there. That is, if the casino is a notable tourist attraction. On the other hand, if not many people come from outside the area, there are few benefits. In this case, most of the gamblers are local people who are spending a little money they have. Gambling is especially attractive to older and retired people. Since older people don't have much chance of making a lot of new money, the thought of winning the jackpot is very attractive to them. Casinos regularly run buses from retirement homes so that seniors can come and gamble. Some would see this as taking advantage of lonely people. There are stories in the newspaper about couples leaving their children locked in the car for six or eight hours while they gamble. One man hoped to improve his finances by gambling, but he lost heavily. His wife found out and went gambling herself, hoping to win some of the money back. Before long, they had to sell their house to pay their gambling debts. Gambling has usually been associated with organized crime. Even today, when government agencies supervise gambling, it would appear that there is still a crime connection. This may be because many of the best gamblers and gambling administrators learn their trade outside of the law. Besides this, gambling establishments attract various forms of crime to the area. Since law and government have an important educational function, one doesn't like to see them involved in gambling. Government should be more than profit maximizers. They should be concerned chiefly with the public good.",181.5249375,172.5382772821503,Fast

The shadows were deep and dark. The ghost stories were making my imagination play tricks on me. I thought that the shadows were moving. I looked under my bed to make sure that nothing was under there. I hid under the covers and peaked out. I was starting to hear things. A big streak of lightning flashed across the sky and a loud clap of thunder made me jump. I was very nervous. All of a sudden I heard a noise. It was coming from my closet. I thought that it must be a ghost. I looked out from under my covers and waited for the ghost to appear. My face was white and I was very, very scared. Then I heard the noise again. Yes, there was definitely a rustling in my closet. I stayed very still and did not make a sound. I watched the closet and hoped that the ghost would not come flying out at me. Something started to come out of the closet. I squeezed my eye shut. I didn't dare look at the ghost. I heard it come out of the closet. I felt it jump up on my bed. I was still too scared to look.

I'll show you around today and explain how to use these facilities. Hopefully, when I'm done with it, you'll know the ropes, and please feel free to let me know of any questions or concerns that you may have. Now we're at the gate of the library. Upon entering into the door, you'll find that the rest rooms are on your left-hand side, and opposite them is a photocopy room. Many of you are wondering about the check-in and check-out process. What you have to do is go to the circulation desk, which is to the east of the photocopy room. The reading room is a really large area in the center of the library, just to the north of the circulation desk. I'm sure you won't miss it. If you're here to do research, this is where you should bring books to look through. However, if you're here to do any group projects or other interactive activities, I advise you to use one of the study rooms, which are just to the east of the reading room. Moving on to the southeast corner, we have the Periodical Section, just next to the study rooms. We have a collection of different newspapers and magazines in this section. You can get last week's weather reports, or all the top stories five years ago. Our Periodicals can be traced back 20 years to the time when our school library was built. Ah, our first question, yes. Can we check out magazines from the library? I'm sorry, but you cannot take any Periodicals out of the library. You're welcome to read them for as long as you want while you're here, but you cannot check them out. I wonder if there is any place where we can get some food in the library. Do we have a store here? Of course. The Food Service Center is just meters away from the study rooms. It's on the northeast corner as you look at the map. The Food Service Center offers different kinds of snacks, though it's not big. Well, moving on along to the west, you will find the Video Resource Center on your right hand. We have educational videos and documentaries as well as major motion pictures. We ask that you pay attention to the tag on the video that you pick up. As many of our documentaries are for onsite viewing only and may not be taken out of the library. To the west of the Video Resource Center is our satellite TV station. Here we stream the news from Channel 19 for most of the day. How many channels does it have? It does have nearly 200 channels, but we generally will give top priority to channels with some big events, like presidential addresses or other breaking news. During the coverage of the presidential debate, students will take a break from studying and flock to watch it. Last, but perhaps most important is the inquiry desk. It's just on the left hand side when you walk into the library. So it's impossible to miss it. If you have any questions about how to use equipment or where to find something, come and ask the assistant. Don't be shy, because that's what they're here for. Speaking of questions, one of the questions we get asked is how to actually check out a book once a student has picked one out. If it's a fiction or non-fiction book, look for the pink and yellow checkout card inside the back cover of the book. You can also find information about the book on these cards, including its publishing date, genre, ISBN, and a log of dates it's been checked out before. Present this card to me or any library assistant, and we'll stamp it, and then the book can be kept for three weeks. You can find general information on a field of study by using one of our subject guides. We have them on paper here, but any of our computers will allow you to search within fields as well. What if the library doesn't have a resource we're looking for? Great question. I'm going to address that. Our library is a network with a number of other universities in the area, so if there is something you're looking for and it's available somewhere in the area, we'll be able to get it for you. However, there are universities which are not part of the network, so we do not share resources with them. If you want more information about the library and its resources, you'll find it in a labeled blue folder on my desk in the Enquiry section. OK, so that's a lot of information all at once, and I don't expect you to remember it all. The most important thing is please be respectful of the staff, and if you need help with anything at all, come and ask me or one of the assistants. All right.

short-stories-0269-272-john-chapman-american-pioneer.wav,"John Chapman, American pioneer. When the first Europeans came to North America, they found dense forests coming down right to the shore. So thick were the forests that it was said that a squirrel could travel from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River without once touching the ground. Clearing these trees to make room for fields and buildings was a very difficult task for the early settlers. Another difficulty was finding enough food in this new land. Many European crops could not grow in this climate, carrying and storing seeds over a long period was also risky. Native Indians were often helpful in teaching the settlers how to find food, but sometimes there were no Indians nearby or they were hostile. John Chapman is famous today because he helped the early settlers grow one important product. Apples. Apples could be eaten fresh in the fall or stored through the winter. They could be made into fresh apple juice or alcohol exciter. They could be dried or made into apple sauce. Apples also could be made into vinegar, which is very useful for keeping vegetables from spoiling. John Chapman was born in Massachusetts in 1774, the year before the American Revolution began. John's father joined George Washington's army to fight for American independence from Great Britain. While the war was going on, John's mother died. In 1870, John's father married again and soon John had lots of younger brothers and sisters. John probably worked on his father's farm as he was growing up. Then he worked on neighboring farms. It may be at this time that John began to learn about apples. After the Revolutionary War, the population of the USA was expanding. Many Americans wanted to go west over the mountains to find land in Indian territory. In the fall of 1797, young John Chapman headed west to Pennsylvania. On his way, he gathered leftover apple seeds from the cider mills that he passed. As usual, John walked barefoot, but as he traveled, snow began to fall. He tore strips off his coat and tied them around his feet. Then he made snowshoes out of tree branches. When he arrived in the west, he began to clear land and plant apple seeds. This began a pattern that would last Chapman's whole life. He would travel ahead of the settlers, clear land, and then sell his baby apple trees to the settlers when they arrived. When the area became too settled, Chapman would move further west and start again. Many settlers regarded John Chapman as a strange character. He never bought new clothes, but wore whatever old clothes came his way. And he was always welcome at a settlers' cabin. John was good at clearing land, telling stories, and growing apples. He liked children and children like him. He was a religious man and would read to the settlers about God and living together peacefully. At this time, there was conflict between the settlers and Indians about land. John managed to be friendly with both groups, but John did warn the settlers if the Indians were planning to attack them. Every fall, John went east to gather more apple seeds. He would then go farther west and find some empty land to plant his seeds. During the warm weather, he tended all his fields of baby apple trees. Once they were properly grown, he sold the seedlings to settlers. When he had earned enough money, he bought land to grow more apple trees. In his own lifetime, he became known as Johnny Apple Seed. Legends grew up about him. John was said that his bare feet could melt snow and that he could leap across rivers. Johnny Apple Seed never built himself a real home. He was a wanderer all his life, traveling west to Indiana and Iowa and back east again. He enjoyed sleeping outdoors, lying on his back, looking up at the stars, and thinking about God and his world. He died in Indiana in 1845, and no one knows exactly where he's buried, but all through that region are hundreds of apple trees. These apple trees are the most fitting memorial to John Chapman, the legendary Johnny Apple Seed.",255.138,165.0871293182513,Fast

The week that we were there was very hot. The sun was hot, but the water was still very cold. I went swimming and tried to catch little fish in my hands. I was careful not to get sunburned. We stayed at a hotel that had a pool and a game room. I played pinball and video games sometimes. I liked to swim in the hotel pool, but I liked the beach better. I would lie on a big beach towel and get warm, then I would jump in the water and cool off. Sometimes I would just lie on the sand and watch the waves roll up on shore. I found some seashells and saw a crab walking on the sand. At first I was a bit lonely because I didn't know anyone there. It wasn't long before I met some other kids my age. We built sandcastles together and swam in the lake. The other kids were from different towns, so we told each other stories about our schools and friends. We found that we had a lot in common, even though we were from different places. Our families got together and went to restaurants together. We played volleyball on the beach and we sat around a campfire at night and sang songs. At the campfire we would roast marshmallows on a stick. I always burn my marshmallows. That is okay. I like them that way. Mostly we just swam in the lake until we were very tired. I was sorry when our vacation was over. I had a good time at Lake Huron. I met some very good friends there.

ielts-listening-0314-ielts-recent-actual-test-31-part-2.wav,"Hello everyone and welcome to the University of New South Wales. The first thing I'd like to do today's orientation session is get you all oriented. That means tell you the location of some useful facilities and services. So first of all, take out the maps we gave you all as you came in the door. The map is the big yellow sheet of paper. As you can see on the map, north is at the top, south at the bottom, etc. Which way is north? Well, look through that window on my left, you're right. See the rising sun? That would have to be east. So north must be directly behind me. Now, we're at the campus main gate. The recreational facilities are on my right hand and its opposite is the student centre. No questions? Good. Pretty easy, right? Okay. Did everyone eat breakfast at the student food service this morning? Was the food good? Yes, yes, I am joking. I've eaten there too. So after a meal like that, you must be eager to go to a doctor, right? Well, I have good news for you. The student health centre is located about half a kilometre straight north of here. Look on your maps. You see the street on the east side of this building? Ned Kelly Avenue? Just follow that about 500 metres and the health centre will be on your left at the third cross street. Now, I know you all just got here. So you must be wondering how to tell your folks you've arrived safely, how much you miss the dog, and how you already need more money. If you don't have an iPhone, you probably are wondering where to find a computer. Well, I have good news. If you go straight out of its door and walk down the garden street, you'll see the internet unit on your left side, just next to the gym. The hours are posted on the door and the computers are free, but you must bring your student ID card with you. Like I tell everyone, if you need help with anything, you can probably find right here in the student centre. Do you see the four buildings there between the student centre and the library? Those are the dormitories. The men's dorms are the two on the south, the women's are the two on the north. Okay, now I'm sorry to have to tell you, but the university has been doing a lot of repairs and remodeling and it's not all done yet. So there may be some small problems with your dorm rooms. Maybe the window doesn't open. Maybe an air conditioner is missing or does not work. If there are any problems, you can go to the complaint office, which is right beside the teaching building, between the parkour street and the Krammer street. Just tell them your problem and they should have it fixed by the time you graduate in four years. I'm joking, but please be patient. There are a lot of little things they need to take care of. Tired of the school food? No? Give it a week. Or maybe you just need a place to get coffee in the wee hours of the night during one of those marathon study sessions. Either way, you definitely have to check out the little cafe, just past the women's dormitories. They've got free Wi-Fi, so a lot of students saddle up with coffee and a bagel for hours on in to get work done. As for the dorm rooms, I have some bad news and some good news. The bad news is the rooms are small and you'll probably be sharing space with at least three other students. The good news is that each room has its own bathroom. Is good about sharing a bathroom with three strangers? Hmm, good question. Okay, call it bad news and worse news. Hey, maybe try this for good news. Each dorm has a kitchen. If you want to make snacks or meals, you can do it there. You can buy food containers at any campus convenience store, so you can store your food in the kitchen. But a word of warning, you should definitely write your name on your food containers. Sad to say there are food thieves among your fellow students. Speaking of thieves, a word about security. I mean, this is Australia and we do get drunken bush rangers wondering onto campus. Each of you will be given a key for your dorm room. Don't lose it. You have to pay for any replacement and fill out a bunch of papers too. Red taper. Your key does not work for the front door of your dorm, however. To the right of each door, there's a keypad with numbers. When you move in, they will tell you the code you use to enter the door. Please do not tell the code to people who do not live in the dorm. Let's see. Have I forgotten anything? Oh yes. Most of you are not rich, correct? So when your clothes get dirty, you can't just throw them away and buy new ones. That means you have to learn to do laundry. Or men, that means you have to hurry up and get married. If you decide to wash those clothes and not get married, there are laundries in each dorm. Where? Oh, I almost forgot to tell you. The laundry for each dorm is in the basement. Some real good news this time if you're a student, it is free. You do have to buy your own soap, however. The laundry closes by the buy at 11.30. And now that I've mentioned 11.30, please remember the dorm doors are locked at 11.30pm. Your code will not work. If you want to get in, you'll have to call the night watchman. Don't worry, you can get that number at the dorm office. Yes, the dorm office and the complaint office are the same office.

Some people feel like they have weak knees. Their legs feel as if they are made of rubber. Their heart beats very hard inside of their chest. Their palms get sweaty. Some people even become short of breath. For some people, giving a speech is their worst fear. When you give a speech, everyone is looking at you. They are waiting to hear what you have to say. When you have 300 people looking at you, you have 600 eyes that are on you. It is a little frightening when you think of it that way. Before I give a speech, I take three big breaths. I calm myself and I remind myself that what I have to say is important. I like to be sure of what I am going to say so I practice my speech in front of a mirror at home.

ielts-listening-0172-cam9-test-3-part-4.wav,"Good morning. In the last few lectures, I've been talking about the history of domestic building construction. But today, I want to begin looking at some contemporary experimental designs for housing. So, I'm going to start with a house which is constructed more or less under the ground. And one of the interesting things about this project is that the owners, both professionals but not architects, wanted to be closely involved so they decided to manage the project themselves. Their chief aim was to create somewhere that was as environmentally friendly as possible. But at the same time, they wanted to live somewhere peaceful. They'd both grown up in a rural area and disliked urban life. So the first thing they did was to look for a site and they found a disused stone quarry in a beautiful area. The price was relatively low and they liked the idea of recycling the land as it were. As it was, the quarry was an ugly blot on the landscape and it wasn't productive any longer either. They consulted various architects and looked at a number of designs before finally deciding on one. As I've said, it was a design for a sort of underground house and it was built into the earth itself with two stories. The north, east and west sides were set in the earth and only the sloping south-facing side was exposed to the light. That was made of a double layer of very strong glass. There were also photo-voteic tiles fixed to the top and bottom of this sloping wall. These are tiles that are designed to store energy from the sun and the walls had a layer of foam around them too to increase the insulation. Now, what is of interest to us about this project is the features which make the building energy efficient. Sunlight floods in through the glass wall and to maximize it, there are lots of mirrors and windows inside the house. That helps to spread the light around. So that's the first thing. Light is utilized as fully as possible. In addition, the special tiles on the outside convert energy from the sun and generate some of the house's electricity. In fact, and it is possible that in future, the house may even generate an electricity surplus and that the owners will be able to sell some to the National Grid. As well as that, wherever possible, recycled materials have been used. For example, the floors are made of reclaimed wood and the owners haven't bought a single item of new furniture. They just kept what they already had. And then there's the system for dealing with the waste produced in the house. This is dealt with organically. It's purified by being filtered through read beds which have been planted for that purpose in the garden. So the occupants of the house won't pollute the land or use any damaging chemicals. It's true that the actual construction of the house was harmful to the environment, mainly because they had to use massive amounts of concrete, one of the biggest sources of carbon dioxide in manufacturing. And as you know, this is very damaging to the environment. In total, the house construction has released 70 tons of carbon dioxide into the air. Now that's a frightening thought. However, once the initial debt has been cleared and it's been calculated that this will only take 15 years, this underground house won't cost anything environmentally, I mean, because unlike ordinary houses, it is run in a way that is completely environmentally friendly. So, eco housing like this is likely to become much more.",289.7798125,126.09574036493657,Ideal

Within the Caribbean Sea are many islands that have played an important role in the history and culture of the Western Hemisphere. By far, the largest island in the Caribbean is Cuba. Cuba was formerly a colony of Spain, but became independent in 1902. Cuba became a communist country in 1959 when a revolution overthrew an unpopular government. After the revolution, many Cubans fled to the United States. Today, the American city of Miami in the state of Florida has been greatly influenced by Cuban culture. Tobacco is widely grown in Cuba, and the country is famous for the cigars that are produced in the capital city, Havana. The island of Hispanolla is located just east of Cuba. This island is divided into two countries. In the west is Haiti, where the people speak a variety of the French language that has been influenced by African languages. In the east is the Dominican Republic, where the people speak Spanish. Another important Caribbean island is Puerto Rico. This was previously a Spanish colony, but is now governed by the United States. Many people from Puerto Rico have moved to the mainland United States, especially the New York area. In many other islands in the Caribbean, English is the main language. The largest of these islands is Jamaica, which is located just south of Cuba. Most Jamaicans are the descendants of African people who were brought to work as slaves on sugar plantations. Jamaica is famous as the birthplace of the style of music called reggae, which was popularized in other countries by Bob Marley, a famous Jamaican musician. Another important English-speaking Caribbean island is Trinidad. This island is located just north of South America. The population of Trinidad is very diverse. The largest groups of people are descended from people who came from Africa and India, but there are many other nationalities also. That is famous for a style of music known as calipso, and for musicians who produce pleasant sounds by playing steel drums. There are also many other smaller islands in the Caribbean, each with its own unique features. Many of these islands possess fine beaches, and are popular tourist destinations. The warm weather of the Caribbean makes it a popular place for North Americans who must live through cold winters.",171.702875,141.8729884400596,Ideal

short-stories-0213-215-bjorn-borg.wav,"Bjorn Borg The professional career of tennis player Bjorn Borg was one of the most interesting ones in recent sports history. Borg's success and his sport came at an early age. Borg won Wimbledon when he was only 20 years old. However, by the time he was 26 and in the prime of his career, Borg inexplicably retired from professional tennis. Borg, who began playing tennis at the age of nine, was the number one ranked junior player by the age of 14, and had won the Italian and French Open titles at the age of 18. These were the first of several major championships won by Borg in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Probably his greatest achievement was a winning streak at Wimbledon that spanned five years. Between the years 1976 and 1982, Borg enjoyed almost complete dominance in competitive tennis. His retirement in 1983 then was a bit of a puzzle, although his tennis skills wane somewhat in the previous year, he was still one of the top players on the tour and only 26 years old. Even stranger was the fact that Borg refused to reveal the reasons for his retirement. Following his retirement, Borg encountered a number of personal problems, which kept him in the media spotlight, even though he was no longer playing competitive tennis. Five years after his retirement, an emergency hospital procedure saved his life. While Borg claimed he had food poisoning, it was suspected he had a barbicuit overdose. In 1991, Borg attempted to make a comeback on the professional tennis tour only to fail miserably. His insistence on using a wooden racket at the time when all of the world's top players were using synthetic fiber rackets didn't help matters. At the same time, Borg's second wife attempted to commit suicide and a couple divorced in 1993. Eventually, Borg disappeared into obscurity and there's little news of his life today. These sad stories about the latter part of his career aside, Borg was an important figure in modern tennis history. He was the sports first modern media star in icon. Teenage girls conferred upon him a status comparable to a rock star. His face adorned T-shirts and other merchandise, making him the most marketable tennis player in history. Borg's career was a catalyst for Swedish tennis players. Those who followed in his footsteps and held him up as their hero included tennis stars, Matt Vlander and Stefan Edberg. Perhaps most important of all, Borg gave to the sport of tennis a degree of showmanship, visibility and marketability that was used as a role model for the sport in future decades.",150.4391875,175.486191056436,Fast
ielts-listening-0090-cam14-test-3-part-2.wav,"Good morning, my name's Lucy Cretan-Den and I'm the director of operations for an organization that arranges volunteering in this part of the country. I'm hoping I can persuade one or two of you to become volunteers yourselves. Let me start by briefly explaining what we mean by volunteering. Volunteers are teenagers and adults who choose to spend some time unpaid helping other people in some way. Most volunteers devote two or three hours to this every week while a few do much more. The people they help may have physical or behavioral difficulties, for example. Volunteers can do all sorts of things depending on their own abilities and interests. If they're supporting a family that's struggling, for example, they may be able to give them tips on cooking or recommend how to plan their budget or how to shop sensibly on their income. They might even do some painting or wallpapering, perhaps alongside any members of the family who are able to do it. Or even do some babysitting, so the parents can go out for a while. The benefit from volunteering isn't only for the people being helped. Volunteers also gain from it. They're using their skills to cope with somebody's mental or physical ill health, and volunteering may be a valuable element of their CV when they're applying for jobs. Employers usually look favourably on someone who's given up time to help others. Significantly, most volunteers feel that what they're doing gives them a purpose in their lives, and in my opinion, they're lucky in that respect, as many people don't have that feeling. Now I'd like to tell you what some of our volunteers have said about what they do to give you an idea of the range of ways in which they can help people. Her Beebe supports an elderly lady who's beginning to show signs of dementia. Once a week they, along with other elderly people, go to the local community centre where a group of people come in and sing. The songs take the listeners back to their youth, and for a little while they can forget the difficulties that they face now. Our volunteer Consuela is an amazing woman. She has difficulty walking herself, but she doesn't let that stop her. She helps a couple of people with similar difficulties, who had almost stopped walking altogether. By using herself as an example, Consuela encourages them to walk more and more. Min visits a young man who lives alone and can't leave his home on his own, so he hardly ever saw anyone. But together they go out to the cinema, or to see friends the young man hadn't been able to visit for a long time. Tania visits an elderly woman once a week. When the woman found out that Tania is a professional dressmaker, she got interested. Tania showed her some soft toys she'd made, and the woman decided to try it herself. And now she really enjoys it, and spends hours making toys. They're not perhaps up to Tania's standard yet, but she gains a lot of pleasure from doing it. Alexi is a volunteer with a family that faces a number of difficulties. By calmly talking over possible solutions with family members, he's helping them to realise that they aren't helpless, and that they can do something themselves to improve their situation. This has been great for their self-esteem. And the last volunteer I'll mention, though there are plenty more, is Juba. She volunteers with a teenage girl with learning difficulties, who wasn't very good at talking to other people. Juba's worked very patiently with her, and now the girl is far better at expressing herself, and at understanding other people. Okay, I hope that's given you an idea of what volunteering is all about. Now I'd like to talk to you about...",258.4919375,149.48241857640144,Ideal

This was a story by Philippa Pierce. It was quite a long book, and it took quite a few nights for my mother to read the entire book to me. In Tom's Midnight Garden, Tom moves to the city to stay with his aunt and uncle. He is very bored at their apartment. They have no children, so Tom has nothing to do. One night, the clock strikes 13 times. Tom knows that this is impossible. A clock can only strike up to 12 times. He sneaks downstairs and goes outside. When he goes outside, there is a wonderful garden that wasn't there the day before. The next day, Tom goes outside and finds there is no garden. The garden only seems to appear at night. Every night, Tom slips out to this wonderful garden and meets some people in the garden. He meets a girl named Hadi. Hadi and Tom become very good friends in this garden. Some very strange things happen in this book. There are some coincidences that keep you guessing about what is really going on. The surprise ending is wonderful. I really enjoyed Tom's Midnight Garden and I was very sad when my mother and I came to the end of the book. I felt that I had visited the magical garden with Tom.

short-stories-0229-231-plains-indians.wav,"Plains Indians. The best known picture of an American Indian is a warrior in Buckskin, riding a horse, wearing a headdress of eagle feathers, and carrying a spear or bow and arrow. This is a picture of a Plains Indian, and it appears in many Hollywood westerns and on the American five-cent piece. There were many tribes of Plains Indians. For the northern American prairies or plains stretched from the northern forest of western Canada down to the states of Oklahoma and Texas in southern USA. It's interesting that our image of the Plains Indian is only true for the last couple hundred years. It was not until the 1600s that Plains Indians began to ride horses. There were no horses in America until Spanish soldiers brought them in the 1500s and 1600s. Some of these horses escaped and ran wild on the prairies of America. It was these wild horses that the Plains Indians learned to tame. Before they had horses, the Indians hunted buffalo on foot. Buffalo were huge bison or wild cattle which traveled in very large herds. A big herd might have millions of buffalo. It was difficult to cross the prairie because these animals blocked your way. The Plains Indians had various ways of killing buffalo. Before they had horses, Indian hunters would quietly creep up close to the herd. Then they would fire their arrows together. There was always the danger that the herd would stampede and trample the hunters. Another method was to drive the buffalo over a steep cliff. There are a number of places on the plains where this was done. Once the Plains Indians had horses, they preferred to hunt buffalo on horseback. When the tribes started to use guns, they could kill many buffalo. Artist Paul Kane describes a buffalo hunt in the Red River Valley in 1846. The hunters carried their bullets and their mouths so that they could shoot faster. They could ride right into the herd, shooting at close quarters. They would drop an article of clothes on the slain buffalo to market for themselves. Then they would continue the hunt. After the hunt, the Indians would skin the animals and the women would drive the meat and store it in fat. A single hunt might kill more than 30,000 buffalo. The Plains Indians received nearly everything they needed from the buffalo. Of course, they used buffalo meat for food. They also used the buffalo skins for clothing, blankets, and the covering of their teepees. These teepees were cone-shaped tents, which were easy to put up and take down. The Plains Indians were nomadic and followed the animals they hunted. Since these animals were plentiful, Plains Indians usually led a comfortable life. They developed complex religions and social rituals, as well as specialized societies or clubs. There were also rituals and customs for hunting and warfare. Many Plains Indians fought hard against the settlement of the Great Plains. The American government discouraged the hunting of buffalo because without the buffalo, the Plains Indians would not be able to fight. With the buffalo disappearing, the Plains Indians had to give up fighting and move into government-sponsored reservations.",197.17225,161.28030186803673,Fast

Power_English_Update.wav,"Hi, this is AJ with another effortless English podcast. So today is Monday and I'm here in San Francisco. I'm back in San Francisco. Last week we were in Texas. We were at a teaching conference and the leader of the teaching conference was Blaine Ray. And first I just want to say some nice things about Blaine Ray because he's a super nice person. He's a fantastic teacher. He's a great teacher trainer. He really helps teachers become better and better. And I went to Moe went and Kristen went and Joe went. We all learned a lot. We will all improve our teaching as a result of going to the conference. So thank you Blaine Ray. You are great. See the next thing that happened last week was that our computers crashed. Oh no, oh no. Yes our website crashed. So what happened? First we got too many visitors. We got a lot of traffic. People watching the videos and trying to comment all suddenly same time. So that crashed our site. Our website went down. But you know that's okay. That's not a terrible problem. Usually you can recover quickly. But the next problem was that our backup file, our website backup had a problem. The website host, Bluehost, Pugh. Terrible. Don't use them. Bluehost, their backup file was bad. It had some, it was corrupt is what they say. But it basically had some problems. It was broken a little bit. So we could not get the website up again quickly. So finally our computer engineer, his name is Vic Medcalf. He worked hard, he worked, he worked. Trying to talk to Bluehost again and again. Finally he got a good backup file. Then we moved everything to new computers, new servers and a new web host. Doing expensive, high quality and professional. So now we are ready for a lot of traffic suddenly. And that's good because our English is coming soon. Our one day only sale. Unfortunately we must change the date again. We were hoping for tomorrow. But because our website crashed last week we need to delay. Our English just one more week. So the new date, the final date, the one day only sale for Power English is now August 4th. August 4th, that's next Tuesday, August 4th. One day only Power English sale. Now to get Power English you must be on my email list. You must join the 7 Rules email course. Because what happens at 12.01 am. Just after midnight in New York City, that's New York City time, I will send an email to everybody in the 7 Rules email list. That actually will be almost 1 million people. Because our friends, Kristen and Joe, they are also sending emails. Anyway, you will get an email and it will have a link inside. Click the link. The link will go to the Power English sale page. Then you just click that big red button. It will say bye lessons now, etc. Click that red button. You get Power English. So if you don't know about Power English then you probably are not on my email list. And don't worry about it, you're fine. You can just listen to my podcast. It's too late for me to tell you everything about Power English now. But if you are wanting Power English then you need to be on my email list. And you probably already are. Okay, so anyway, so August 4th, it's only one day and only 15,000 copies. So we are limiting the number of lessons on August 4th to just 15,000. I think probably most of those will be gone quickly in a few hours. So if you really want Power English, I recommend that you open your email immediately at 12.01am. Just after midnight, you know, midnight, you have August 3rd, 11.59. And midnight becomes August 4th in New York City. Check your email. That's when the email will come and that's when you can get Power English. Okay, so enough of that. What else am I doing? So I just finished doing some videos because we lost a little bit of work, a little bit from the website crash just three days. So today I have been making videos and doing some work to recover what we lost. And then later tonight actually we are going to see Harry Potter. I'm going to see the new Harry Potter movie.

We're all going to see the new Harry Potter movie. Yay! And you know I have never read the Harry Potter books. So I don't know what happens in this story. So the movies are fun for me. When the new movies come, I really have no idea what's going to happen. So I enjoy it. Maybe someday I'll read the books. So again, anyway, that's it. I guess that's the big update. So the computers are working again. We have a totally new system, very professional and expensive unfortunately. But that's okay. Very professional. We are ready for a lot of traffic now. We are growing fast. And now we're ready. We are ready for almost 1 million people, possibly, to come and try to get power English.

However, there is more to being a good citizen than merely obeying laws. There are many other things that people can do to make their society a pleasant one for every person. One way to be a good citizen is to be polite in everyday activities. For example, when passing through a door, a considerate person will hold the door open for a person who is close behind. Holding doors open is especially important when someone is carrying a heavy load. Being a good citizen is very important when traveling on the roads and streets. Pedestrians, bicyclists, and car drivers should all follow the rules of the road. Bicyclists should yield to pedestrians, and car drivers should yield to both bicyclists and pedestrians. Drivers should also allow other drivers to merge into their lanes. Also, drivers should avoid honking their horns except when this is necessary. A good citizen will also avoid doing things that interfere with others. For example, a considerate person does not smoke cigarettes in areas where this might irritate others. Also, a polite person avoids playing music so loudly that other people will be annoyed. And of course, a good citizen avoids littering or making a mess. Other ways of being a good citizen involve greater effort. Some people serve their community by doing volunteer work of some kind. Other people help by donating money to a charity. Another way to serve the community is to donate blood. Blood donors are needed so that there will be enough blood available to help people who are sick or injured. Being a good citizen is very helpful for the community, and it also gives a feeling of satisfaction and pride.",121.3388125,149.33391572461613,Ideal

ielts-listening-0048-cam17-test-4-part-4.wav,"Hello everyone! Today we're going to look at another natural food product and that's maple syrup. What is this exactly? Well, maple syrup looks rather like clear honey, but it's not made by bees. It's produced from the plant fluid or sap inside the maple tree and that makes maple syrup a very natural product. Maple syrup is a thick golden, sweet-tasting liquid that can be bought in bottles or jars and poured onto food such as waffles and ice cream or used in the baking of cakes and pastries. It contains no preservatives or added ingredients and it provides a healthy alternative to refined sugar. Let's just talk a bit about the maple tree itself, which is where maple syrup comes from. So there are many species of maple tree and they'll grow without fertilizer in areas where there's plenty of moisture in the soil. However, they'll only do this if another important criterion is fulfilled, which is that they must have full or partial sun exposure during the day and very cool nights. And I'll talk more about that in a minute. There are only certain parts of the world that provide all these conditions. One is Canada and by that I mean all parts of Canada and the other is the Northeastern states of North America. In these areas the climate suits the trees perfectly. In fact, Canada produces over two thirds of the world's maple syrup, which is why the five-pointed maple leaf is a Canadian symbol and has featured on the flag since 1964. So how did maple syrup production begin? Well, long before Europeans settled in these parts of the world, the indigenous communities had started producing maple sugar. They bored holes in the trunks of maple trees and used containers made of tree bark to collect the liquid sap as it poured out. As they were unable to keep the liquid for any length of time, they didn't have storage facilities in those days. They boiled the liquid by placing pieces of rock that had become scorching hot from the sun into the sap. They did this until it turned into sugar and they were then able to use this to sweeten their food and drinks. Since that time improvements have been made to the process, but it has changed very little overall. So let's look at the production of maple syrup today. Clearly, the maple forests are valuable resource in many Canadian and North American communities. The trees have to be well looked after and they cannot be used to make syrup until the trunks reach a diameter of around 25 centimeters. This can take anything up to 40 years. As I've already mentioned, maple trees need the right conditions to grow and also to produce sap. Why is this? Well, what happens is that during a cold night the tree absorbs water from the soil and that rises through the tree's vascular system. But then in the warmer daytime, the change in temperature causes the water to be pushed back down to the bottom of the tree. This continual movement up and down leads to the formation of the sap needed for maple syrup production. When the tree is ready, it can be tapped and this involves drilling a small hole into the trunk and inserting a tube into it that ends in a bucket. The trees can often take several taps, though the workers take care not to cause any damage to the healthy growth of the tree itself. The sap that comes out of the trees consists of 98% water and 2% sugar and other nutrients. It has to be boiled so that much of that water evaporates and this process has to take place immediately using what are called evaporators. These are basically extremely large pans. The sap is poured into these. A fire is built and the pans are then heated until the sap boils. As it does this, the water evaporates and the syrup begins to form. The evaporation process creates large quantities of steam and the sap becomes thicker and denser and at just the right moment when the sap is thick enough to be called maple syrup, the worker removes it from the heat. After this process, something called sugar sand has to be filtered out as this builds up during the boiling and gives the syrup a cloudy appearance and a slightly gritty taste. Once this has been done, the syrup is ready to be packaged so that it can be used for a whole variety of products. It takes 40 liters of sap to produce one liter of maple syrup so you can get an idea of how much is needed. So that's the basic process.",360.777,132.0483290231916,Ideal
ielts-listening-0296-ielts-recent-actual-test-6-part-4.wav,"We all know about the role of carbon dioxide in causing global warming. Obviously, society needs to reduce the release of carbon dioxide, otherwise known as CO2. This gas comes from the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, and it is virtually impossible for society to prevent or even limit such activity. Our need for energy and power is just too great. Instead, a more practical idea is to collect the carbon dioxide from the burning process, for example, directly from the chimneys of power stations, and somehow prevent this gas from being released into the environment. To do that, you need to store it somehow, and that has to be essentially forever. It is perhaps for this reason that many believe that, rather than storing the carbon dioxide as a gas, it is better to react it with metal oxides, such as magnesium or calcium, which results in the formation of a hard carbonate material. The gas is, in effect, turned into a stable and unreactive solid, which can simply be dumped anywhere. This process actually occurs naturally, although very, very slowly, and is one cause of the surface limestone in the world. But this slow reaction speed is the problem. Even when enhancing this process through high temperature and pressure, or pretreatment of the mineral, it is still far too slow to be economical. One other technique, which has been suggested, is to pump the gas to the bottom of the ocean, where it would react with compounds in the seawater, forming carbonic acid. However, this alternative has now been ruled out. The CO2 may be removed from the atmosphere, but the high oceanic acidity which would result raises its own set of problems, mostly with all the delicate life and the intricate food chains in the seawater, someone which we ourselves depend, and that's something which no one wants to experiment with. Perhaps because of the lack of alternatives, the most commonly discussed solution to the problem of disposing of carbon dioxide is to pump the gas underground. A technique known as geosequastration. In this system, the CO2, for example, could be pumped into underground pockets within depleted oil wells, or disused coal tunnels. This carries however three serious disadvantages. Namely, the risk of leaks, the considerable costs involved, and finally the unproven effectiveness. Let us look at those three disadvantages in detail. Firstly, there is the risk of leaks. Although the gas would be deep and sealed over by masses of rock and earth, the huge pressures in these spaces would turn the gas into a liquid state, capable of moving through rock fishes or faults. This could allow the gas to eventually be released to the surface. Since CO2 is heavier than air, and thus pushes oxygen aside, such leaks could result in the suffocation of thousands, or tens of thousands of people, certainly not a consequence to be taken lightly. Although CO2 leakage from volcanic build-up has already witnessed such deadly events, the other problem of geosequastration is the cost. The time and effort spent on materials and construction, primarily the pipework through which the gas would travel, does not come cheaply. So if this system were to be implemented in, say, coal-fired power plants, the extra cost would have to be paid by the electricity user, whose bills would almost double as a consequence. Few people are prepared to pay this much simply to make a small dent on the effects of global warming, and this leads to the final problem. The most basic question is whether geosequastration actually reduces global warming. The problem here is that the energy needed to create and drive the sequestration process would require approximately a quarter of a coal-fired electricity plant's output. In other words, the plant would have to burn one quarter more of its coal just to account for the sequestration of the carbon dioxide, and with coal producing other noxious pollutants, such as sulfur, ash, and heavy metals, the environment is hardly benefited at all. Nevertheless, there are many active experimental efforts underway, primarily in oil production sites. These are small but intensively monitored and analysed. All we can say now is that the jury is still out on whether underground carbon storage will one day be feasible.",321.2848125,133.89988672433745,Ideal

ielts-listening-0044-cam17-test-3-part-4.wav,"Scientists believe that a majority of the Earth's bird population migrate in some fashion or other. Some travel seasonally for relatively short distances, such as birds that move from their winter habitats in lowlands to mountain tops for the summers. Others, like the Arctic turn, travel more than 25,000 miles seasonally between the northern and southern poles. Bird migration has been studied over many centuries through a variety of observations, but until relatively recently, where birds went to in the winter was considered something of a mystery. The lack of modern science and technology led to many theories that we now recognise as error-filled and even somewhat amusing. Take hibernation theory, for example, 2000 years ago, it was commonly believed that when birds left an area, they went underwater to hibernate in the seas and oceans. Another theory, for the regular appearance and disappearance of birds, was that they spent winter hidden in mud till the weather changed and food became abundant again. The theory that some birds hibernate persisted until experiments were done on caged birds in the 1940s, which demonstrated that birds have no hibernation instinct. One of the earliest naturalists and philosophers from ancient Greece was Aristotle, who was the first writer to discuss the disappearance and reappearance of some bird species at certain times of year. He developed the theory of transmutation, the seasonal change of one species into another by observing red starts and robins. He observed that in the autumn, small birds called red starts began to lose their feathers, which convinced Aristotle that they changed into robins for the winter and back into red starts in the summer. These assumptions are understandable, given that this pair of species are similar in shape, but are a classic example of an incorrect interpretation based on correct observations. The most bizarre theory was put forward by an English amateur scientist, Charles Morton, in the 17th century. He wrote a surprisingly well-regarded paper, claiming that birds migrate to the moon and back every year. He came to this conclusion as the only logical explanation for the total disappearance of some species. One of the key moments in the development of migration theory came in 1822, when a white stalk was shot in Germany. This particular stalk made history because of the long spear in its neck, which incredibly had not killed it. Everyone immediately realized this spear was definitely not European. It turned out to be a spear from a tribe in Central Africa. This was a truly defining moment in the history of ornithology because it was the first evidence that stalks spend their winters in sub-Saharan Africa. You can still see the arrow stalk in the zoological collection of the University of Roestock in Germany. People gradually became aware that European birds moved south in autumn and north in summer, but didn't know much about it until the practice of catching birds and putting rings on their legs became established. Before this, very little information was available about the actual destinations of particular species and how they travelled there. People speculated that larger birds provided a kind of taxi service for smaller birds by carrying them on their backs. This idea came about because it seemed impossible that small birds, weighing only a few grams, could fly over vast oceans. This idea was supported by observations of bird behavior, such as the harassment of larger birds by smaller birds. The development of bird ringing by a Danish schoolteacher, Hans Christian Cornelius Mortensen, made many discoveries possible. This is still common practice today and relies upon what is known as recovery. This is when ringed birds are found dead in the place they have migrated to and identified. Huge amounts of data were gathered in the early part of the 20th century, and for the first time in history, people understood where birds actually went to in winter. In 1931, an atlas was published showing where the most common species of European birds migrated to. More recent theories about bird migration vary.",328.9509375,123.3010621834753,Ideal

short-stories-0164-165-louis-pasteur.wav,"Louis Pasteur. Louis Pasteur was one of the greatest scientists of all time. Pasteur made very important discoveries in biology and chemistry and the techniques he developed helped greatly develop medical science and the agricultural and food industries. Pasteur was born in a small town in France during the year 1822. When he was a young man Pasteur studied science at a university in the city of Paris. He soon did some excellent work in chemistry and later began his famous study of germs. Pasteur was one of the first scientists to understand that many diseases could be caused by extremely small invisible organisms. Only a few other scientists had believed this before Pasteur. He advised doctors to wash their hands thoroughly before treating patients. Pasteur also demonstrated that life forms did not arise spontaneously. His research confirmed the idea. Developed by previous scientists that a living organism would not appear unless other individuals of its kind were present. One of Pasteur's most important contributions was a technique that has been named after him. Pasteurization. Pasteurization kills the germs that are found in drinks such as milk or beer. Because of Pasteur's technique, people are no longer infected with diseases by drinking these liquids. Just as important as Pasteurization was a technique called immunization. Pasteur found that a person or animal could be made safe or immune from a disease by injecting the person with some weakened germs that caused the disease. The body can resist the disease after being immunized in this way. Today, many diseases are prevented by the use of this technique. Pasteur's discoveries also helped save people who had already been infected with diseases. One such disease is rabies. Rabies is a disease that sometimes occur in animals. This disease usually kills the animal, but before dying, the animal becomes very aggressive and may spread the disease by biting a person or another animal. One day, the parents of a young boy came to Pasteur. Their son had been bitten by a dog that had the rabies disease. The parents knew that their son would die from the disease unless something could be done to save him. Pasteur agreed to help the boy and the immunization technique saved the boy's life. Pasteur died in 1895. He was greatly admired around the world for his achievements, which have helped all of mankind. Today, Pasteur is considered to be the greatest figure in the history of medicine.",186.5404375,131.55324566020707,Ideal

I think you'll be surprised at the variety we have here, even though we're not far from London. I'll start by telling you about some of the parks and open spaces nearby. One very pleasant place is Halland Common. This has been public land for hundreds of years and what you'll find interesting is that the river Uzz which flows into the sea 80 kilometres away has its source in the common. There's an information board about the plants and animals you can see here and by the way the common is accessible 24 hours a day. Then there's Holt Island which is noted for its great range of trees. In the past, willows were grown here commercially for basket making and this ancient craft has recently been reintroduced. The island is only open to the public from Friday to Sunday because it's quite small and if there were people around every day much of the wildlife would keep away. From there it's just a short walk across the bridge to Longfield Country Park. Longfield has a modern replica of a farm from over 2,000 years ago. Children's activities are often arranged there like bread making and face painting. The park is only open during daylight hours so bear that in mind if you decide to go there. Longfield Park has a programme of activities throughout the year and to give you a sample this is what's happening in the next few days. On Monday you can learn about herbs and how they've been used over the centuries. You'll start with a tour of our herb garden, practice the technique of using them as colour dyes for cloth and listen to an illustrated talk about their use in cooking and medicine. Then on Wednesday you can join local experts to discover the variety of insects and birds that appear in the evening. We keep to a small number of people in the group so if you want to go you'll need to phone the park ranger a few days ahead. There's a small charge which you should pay when you turn up. I'm sure you're all keen to help with the practical task of looking after the park so on Saturday you can join a working party. You'll have a choice of all sorts of activities from planting hedges to picking up litter so you'll be able to change from one to another when you feel like it. The rangers will be hard at work all day but do come and join in even for just a short while. One thing though is to make sure you're wearing something that you don't mind getting dirty or torn.

This slide doesn't really indicate how big it is but anyway you can see the two gates into the park and the main paths. As you can see there's a lake in the northwest of the park with a bird hide to the west of it at the end of a path so it'll be a nice quiet place for watching the birds on the lake. Fairly close to where refreshments are available there's a dog walking area in the southern part of the park leading off from the path. And if you just want to sit and relax you can go to the flower garden. That's the circular area on the map surrounded by paths. And finally there's a wooded area in the western section of the park between two paths. Okay that's enough from me so let's get on and have a look.",240.25425,160.57988568360392,Fast

The helpline was set up 10 years ago by the Students Union and it aims to provide new students to the University with a service that they can use if they need information about practical areas of student life that they're unfamiliar with. Let me give you some examples of the type of help we can offer. We can provide information on financial matters. For example you may feel that your grant is insufficient to see you through college life or you may have some queries regarding the fees you're paying if you're an overseas student. In both cases the helpline would be able to go through things with you and see what the outcome might be. Another area we can help with is what we generally term the domestic area. Things such as childcare and the availability of nursery provision. For example come under this. Then there's academic issues that may arise while you're in the early stages of your course that you may not know what to do about. You may wish to know more about essay deadlines for example or how to use the library. There are all kinds of questions you will find yourself asking are not knowing where to get quick answers from. The helpline would be able to provide these. The last example I've given here is simply termed social and yes there is a lot of social life here but you may have a particular interest you wish to pursue or you may wish to participate in outings or trips if you don't know many people at the moment. Let me give you some details so that you know where to go and who to see if you want to pay us a visit. Generally you'll see our helpline officer Jackie Kouachi that's K-O-U-A-C-H-I. Jackie is a full-time employee of the student union and she works in the student welfare office. That's the office that deals with all matters related to student welfare and it's located at 13 Marshall Road. I have some maps here for those of you who haven't been there yet. If you wish to ring the office the number is 326-9940. That's 326-9940. The office is open between 9.30 and 6 o'clock on weekdays and from 10 to 4 on Saturdays and there'll be somebody there usually Jackie or myself between those times. If you want to make an appointment you can phone or call at the office in person. Please note that it may not be possible for anyone to see you straight away particularly if it's a busy time lunchtime for example and you may have to go on the waiting list and then come back later.

ielts-listening-0168-cam9-test-2-part-4.wav,"Good morning, everyone. Now whether you're going to university to study business or some other subject, many of you will eventually end up working for a company of some kind. Now when you first start working somewhere you will realize that the organization you've joined has certain characteristics, and we often refer to these social characteristics as the culture of the organization. This includes its unwritten ideas, beliefs, values, and things like that. One well-known writer has classified company cultures by identifying four major types. The first type is called the power culture, and it's usually found in small organizations. It's the type of culture that needs a central source of power to be effective, and because control is in the hands of just one or two people, there aren't many rules or procedures. Another characteristic is that communication usually takes the form of conversations rather than, say, formal meetings or written memos. Now one of the benefits of this culture is that the organization has the ability to act quickly, so it responds well to threat or danger on the one hand, and opportunity on the other. But on the negative side this type of organization doesn't always act effectively, because it depends too much on one or two people at the top, and when these people make poor decisions, there is no one else who can influence them. And the kind of person who does well in this type of business culture is one who is happy to take risks, and for whom job security is a low priority. The next type is known as role culture, that's R-O-L-E, not RO-Double-L, by the way. And this type is usually found in large companies, which have lots of different levels in them. These organizations usually have separate departments that specialize in things like finance or sales or maintenance or whatever. Each one is coordinated at the top by a small group of senior managers, and typically everyone's job is controlled by sets of rules and procedures. For example, there are specific job descriptions, rules for discipline, and so on. What are the benefits of this kind of culture? Well, firstly, because it's found in large organizations, its fixed costs or overheads, as they're known, are low in relation to its output or what it produces. In other words, it can achieve economies of scale. And secondly, it is particularly successful in business markets where technical expertise is important. On the other hand, this culture is often very slow to recognize the need for change, and even slower to react. What kind of person does this type of culture suit? Well, it suits employees who value security, and who don't particularly want to have responsibility. Moving on now to task cultures, this type is found in organizations that are project-oriented. You usually find it where the market for the company's product is extremely competitive, or where the products themselves have a short lifespan. Usually top management delegates the projects, the people, and other resources, and once these have been allocated, little day-to-day control is exercised from the top, because this would seem like breaking the rules. Now one of the major benefits of this culture is that it's flexible, but it does have some major disadvantages, too. For instance, it can't produce economies of scale, or great depth of expertise. People who like working in groups or teams prefer this type of culture. And finally, the fourth category is called the person culture.",253.66425,137.8988170386643,Ideal
short-stories-0179-180-the-origin-of-canada-and-the-united-states.wav,"The origins of Canada and the United States. Most people are aware that Canada and the United States are two very large countries in North America. However, most people do not know how these countries came to exist. The story of the creation of these countries is a very interesting one. During the 17th and 18th centuries, some people from England and from France moved across the Atlantic Ocean. English people lived on what is now the East Coast of the United States, and French people lived in what is now Quebec, in the eastern part of Canada. The kings of England and France were often at war with each other. This meant that there was often fighting in North America between the soldiers of England and France. By about the year 1750, there were many more people in the English colonies than in the French colonies. When the next war began, the English king was determined to defeat the French and gain complete control of North America. The English assembled a large force of ships and soldiers and attacked the French at Quebec. The French fought bravely, but there were two few in numbers and the English won the war. England then gained control of all of North America. After this war, the people of the English colonies in North America began to feel dissatisfied with their government. They were not represented in the English government, but they had to pay taxes to the English king. The taxes were used to pay for English soldiers who defended the American colonies, but the Americans did not want these soldiers. In 1775, the American settlers began to rebel and in 1776, the Americans declared their independence. For several years, there was much fighting between the Americans and the English soldiers. For a while, it appeared that the Americans would lose, even though they fought bravely. Then, the king of France decided to help the Americans. He sent his ships and soldiers to America, and they helped the Americans to defeat the English forces. England recognized the United States of America as an independent country in 1783. However, England kept control of Canada. When the American colonies rebelled against England, some of the people who lived in those colonies did not rebel. Those people were called loyalists because they were loyal to the king. When the war ended, the loyalists had to leave the country. They moved northward to Canada, where they started new English-speaking colonies. During the year 1812, the Americans invaded Canada, but they were not able to conquer the country. During the 19th century, the people of Quebec continued to speak French and to maintain their French culture. Meanwhile, many more people moved to the English-speaking areas of Canada. In the year 1867, Quebec and the English-speaking colonies agreed to form a single country, Canada. By this time, there were two very large countries in the northern part of North America.",199.967375,147.6240811782422,Ideal

As you know, we're excited to unveil our improvement plan as we look forward to the influx of tourists in the summer months. I'll start with a quick overview of the main points of interest in the area, for anyone who may not quite know here's or her way around yet, and then I'll get to the improvements made. First off is my favourite, the Science Museum, which is on the corner of St George Road. If you have not visited yet, I encourage you to go before the busy season. It is absolutely spectacular. There is even a flight simulator you can try out. Just west of the Science Museum is the National History Museum. It's a site not to be missed as well, with each floor devoted to a different era in our nation's history. There are special exhibits for children, with interactive games and fun history lessons too. If you're looking for parking, it is available on the intersection of Queen Street and South King Street in the car park. Standard hourly and daily rates do apply. The best place for souvenirs is the shopping mall, though it gets extremely busy during peak times. You can get there from the tube or the entrance on Timber Road, just south of Cornwell Road. This area has students everywhere, usually from the primary school across the street from the shopping mall. Classes often take field trips and engage in guided tours through the area. So that's the overview of the main sites, and hopefully by now I've given you a general idea of the area. Now I'm going to outline the improvements we have made in our efforts to make the experience even better for each and every one of our visitors. You probably noticed when you first drove into the car park this morning that there is now additional signage to help avoid confusion. The directions were not entirely clear at first, so we have increased the number of one-way signs indicating the correct direction of traffic flow. Not far from there, in line with our mission of giving back to the community, we constructed a brand new playground for the primary school. It is really something to be excited for. The equipment is state of the art, and includes swings, a small climbing wall, and even an obstacle course. Now we'll head north and take a look at the Science Museum. In response to our feedback from past visitors to the museum, there is now free information available, outlining not only upcoming iMacs showing, but also natural wonders like meteor showers, eclipses, and other cool natural events. The Science Museum isn't the only museum improving the experience of its visitors. The National History Museum has added an entire new wing to its facility to accommodate the large crowds of people gathering to see the Civil War exhibit, inventions Timeline exhibit, and other wonderful sections of the museum. The increase in space will definitely give a more calm, comfortable experience for visitors. And finally, remember when there was actually a line at the Mall entrance from the Tube Station? It was terrible trying to get anywhere from the Tube because foot traffic got so backed up sometimes. We have addressed that by adding another entry point into the Mall from the other end of the platform to disperse the crowd. So those are the major improvements we have made. Clearly having too many people that want to visit, and enjoy what our community has to offer the public is a good problem to have, and I am confident that we have made the changes necessary to accommodate the growing interest in the area. As always, we welcome any questions, comments, or concerns about the new improvement plan. In a few minutes I will open up the floor for questions, but you can also contact me or any other board member by email or through the City website. Thank you for coming, and I now encourage you to stay for the Questions and Answers panel occurring between now and 1030.",256.2085625,161.5871054270483,Fast

ielts-listening-0203-cam7-test-3-part-3.wav,"Thanks to all of you for coming along today to hear about how the Robotic Float project is helping with ocean research. Well, first of all we'll look at what a robotic float does and its use. So let's start with the device itself. It looks a bit like a cigar and it's about 1.5 meters long. More importantly, it's full of equipment that's designed to collect data. So it can help us in building up a profile of different factors which work together within the world's oceans. Sounds like a big project, isn't it too big for one country to undertake? That's quite true, but this project is a really good example of international cooperation. Over the last five years scientists from 13 countries have been taking part in the project and launching floats in their area of ocean control. And next year this number will rise to 14 when Indonesia joins the project. That's impressive. But let's move on to how floats work. The operational cycle goes like this. Each of the floats is dropped in the ocean from a boat at a set point and activated from a satellite. Then the float immediately sinks about 2,000 meters. That's two whole kilometers down in the water. It stays up this depth for about 10 days and is carried around by the currents which operate in the ocean at this level. During this time it's possible for it to cover quite large distances, but the average is 50 kilometers. So what is it actually recording? Well at this stage nothing, but as it rises to the surface it collects all sorts of data. Most importantly variations in salinity, that's salt levels and the changes in temperature, a bit like underwater weather balloons. Then when it gets back to the surface all the data is collected is beamed up to the satellite. After about 5 hours on the surface the float automatically sinks, beginning the whole process again. What happens to the data? Well the information is transferred direct to unsure meteorological stations like our one in Hobart and within 4 hours the findings can be on computers and they can be mapped and analysed. You say you're building models of the world's ocean systems but how are they going to be used and more importantly when? Some of the data has already helped in completing projects. For example our understanding of the underlying causes of El Niño events is being confirmed by float data. Another way we are using float data is to help us to understand the mechanics of climate change like global warming and ozone depletion. That's part of an ongoing variability study but the results are still a long way off. However this is not the case with our ocean weather forecasting. Because we know from the floats what the prevailing weather conditions will be in certain parts of the ocean we can advise the Navy on search and rescue missions. That's happening right now and many yachtsmen owe their lives to the success of this project. In addition the float data can help us to look at the biological implications of ocean processes. Would that help with preserving fish stocks? Yes and advising governments on fisheries legislation. We're well on the way to completing a project on this. We hope it will help to bring about more sustainable fishing practices. We'll be seeing the results of that quite soon. It sounds like the data from floats has lots of applications. Yes it does. It's also a powerful agricultural tool. If we were aware of what the weather would be like say next year we could make sure that the farmers planted appropriate grain varieties to produce the best yield from the available rainfall. It sounds a bit like science fiction especially when now we can't even tell them when a drought will break. I agree that this concept is still a long way in the future but it will come eventually and the float data will have made a contribution.",242.09975,167.28641809832519,Fast
short-stories-0146-147-snow.wav,"Snow. Snow is the white substance that falls to the ground during cold weather conditions. Each tiny piece of snow, called a snowflake, is a very small amount of water that has frozen into an unusual shape. During the winter months, huge numbers of snowflakes fall to the ground, covering the land in a white blanket of snow. In many parts of the world, people never see any snow. Snow only falls when there is moisture in the air, and when the temperature falls below the freezing point of water, which is zero degrees Celsius. During the winter, snow falls instead of rain. One advantage of snow is that it allows many fun outdoor activities. Children like to play in the snow. For example, they may make a snowman by rolling snow into a large ball, and then placing these balls of snow on top of each other in the shape of a person. Another fun activity in the snow is skiing. Skies are very long, thin, flat pieces of hard material that one wears on one's feet. Wearing skis allows a person to slide along the surface of the snow. People can ski down the side of a hill, traveling at great speeds. Many people find the sport of downhill skiing to be very exciting. Some people like to ski along flat ground, often traveling great distances. This sport, called Cross Country Skiing, is an excellent way to develop physical fitness. Of course, snow also causes some problems. Snow can make driving dangerous because falling snow makes roads slippery, and on a windy day, blowing snow can make it difficult to see very far. It can also be a lot of work to remove snow from the roads and sidewalks. Snow is a heavy substance, and it must be cleared away using a shovel or a large machine. Many people love the beauty of the land when it is covered by snow. The white covering of snow over the fields and trees can give a feeling of peace and calm. If you have never seen snow before, you should someday experience this strange and wonderful substance.",146.547,146.16471166247007,Ideal

Now, that's our modern university but it has evolved from really rather different origins and it's these really rather different origins that I'm going to talk to you about today. So I'm going to be addressing two questions. First of all, where did the modern university come from and second of all, how was student life different for the medieval students who were the first people studying at institutions like the University of Paris, Bologna, and even places like here at Glasgow? So this lecture has five key things I'm going to look at. First of all, I'm very briefly going to tell you what I mean by medieval history because you need some parameters for this topic. I'm going to give you some quick background on the early history of Western universities and then I'm going to turn to look a bit at medieval student life and I'm going to focus in particular on one university. I'm going to tell you a little bit more about the University of Paris. And then the final thing I'm going to look at is the medieval curriculum and how teaching was done in a medieval university. And what we'll find, I hope, is that although there are some similarities, there are a great deal of differences between then and now. So before we get started, just a quick overview of what I mean by medieval. You might have heard the word the Dark Ages as a historian. We don't like those. That's as a term or the Middle Ages. The period that we're talking about really is from around, before the Rome, about 476, to around the end of the 100 years war in 1453. Different scholars use different dates, but there's a common ones that are used. So really long time period, a thousand years more. And so we split it into phases, the early Middle Ages, the high and the late Middle Ages. And the high Middle Ages are a period that's going to be quite important to us as we explore this topic from around the 11th, 12th, 13th centuries. Now, as a historian, I have to find out about the past from somewhere. And I find out about the past from the sources that were made at the time. Primary sources are the tools of the historian, as you should know. But the primary sources that we have available as medievalists are rather more limited and perhaps unusual than those that you have available as modern historians. So you can see on the slide I've put up a variety of pictures of kinds of sources we might use. I've got up a picture, for example, of the biotapistry. I've got up a picture of a seal, a seal, was something that was used to confirm a document. So a bit like a signature. I've got up a picture that's an illustration from a medical text, showing how to deal with fisculas. I've got up a picture of Shartler Cathedral, a huge building. What does that tell us? It tells us what was important to medieval people. They built their big permanent structures in honour of God. So we have slightly different sources to the ones you might be used to using. We also have rather fewer sources, and so we have to use them a bit more cleverly. We'll be coming back to sources, and the sources we have available to think about student life later in the lecture. I'd like to turn to thinking about broadly how the modern university emerged. I'm going to go right the way back to the classical inheritance of Greek-Horoman education. Classical learning was incredibly sophisticated. There were many schools which were available to men, obviously, but a wide range of men in the empire. In 70 AD, the emperor of Espazion even established some professorships, some chairs of Greek and Latin, because he recognised the importance of a well-educated population to the administration of the empire. Now, I bring this up because the way that learning was done in the classical world through a process of dialectic is still really important in the way that we create knowledge today. Dialectic, quite a tricky word, and dialectic basically means establishing something as correct or true through a dialogue between people who hold different opinions on it. So they are using reasoning to try and establish the truth on a subject. Some of these subjects continue to have resonance, even in the modern day, which started off as classical debates. A famous one, which links classical thinkers with modern philosophers, is the nature of universals. By universals, I mean things like, is goodness something you can only see in individual acts of being good? Or is goodness something that exists in the abstract? Can we decide that something is good or bad without having an example of it? Now, that's something that we still discussed today, but was the debate which separated the thinking of Plato from his student Aristotle. The classical inheritance had a bigger impact on the medieval university than it maybe does directly on the modern use. So let us jump forward a little bit. After the fall of Rome, there was a period of relative chaos in Europe. And amidst this relative chaos, there was a degree of intellectual stagnation. Now, this is debated between scholars how serious this was. There certainly was some retention of classical learning, particularly in the monastic houses. But even through the 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th centuries, schools were mainly restricted to the monasteries. And what they studied was mainly restricted to liturgy, liturgy, the study of how to express worship of God. So there wasn't that big range of things being considered intellectually. This does change in the 9th century when Charlemagne in 800 gets himself crowned emperor. And this part's off the Carolingium Renaissance, a short period of intellectual revival. And it involves setting up schools. He sets up a school at the palace under the auspices of an important British scholar called Alcian. And all three men are obliged to send their sons to school. The Carolingium Renaissance doesn't particularly last, but it does mark the start of a more settled Europe. And in the 10th, 11th and 12th centuries, we start getting schools popping up all over Europe. We get schools popping up in cathedrals, in particular, and also urban schools in towns. These schools are attracting young men of wealth, and they offer the possibility of employment, for example, at the imperial court. Now, that's a very, very brief overview of well over to 1200 years. And I wanted to do that very briefly, to lay the foundations of what I want to really focus on, which is the 12th century intellectual revival, which is when we get the first universities, as we know them today. The first universities are the University of Baleuña, in the south of Europe, and the University of Paris, in the north. So what's so special about the 12th century? The 12th century is a really interesting period. All sorts of things happen. By the 12th century, there were many raids that were happening on Europe from all sorts of groups, the Vikings, the Magyars, the Muslims, all the edge of Europe, basically ended. And with peace came the opportunity for economic prosperity and trade. When you get trade, you get the need for towns. When you get towns with trade, you get the need for literacy. And this is all in the legacy of what Shalamain had set up. And so the 12th century is a new period of stability that allows intellectual life to start to flourish. There's also contact with other cultures, particularly Islam and Byzantium, through the Crusades, but also through trading. And a lot of knowledge had been preserved in these cultures, where it had been lost in Western Europe. One of the things that's really interesting about the 12th century, that you might want to go and find out a little bit more about yourself, is that it marks the start of a movement from the spoken word to the written word as authoritative. Now this is true in all sorts of fields, including, for example, economic transactions, but it is true in education as well. A scholar called Stephen Yego wrote a really interesting book called The Envy of Angels, in which he argues that this is the period when you start to get the move from charismatic pedagogy. And by that he means the presence of a teacher like myself projected a force of charisma onto the students, and that was how they learnt. And there's a move from that being the source of authority to books being the source of authority. And it happens very gradually, as a very interesting idea. All of this is part of the huge social economic religious change that marks the 12th century. So that's the context for the start, the foundation of modern universities. The word university didn't actually originally mean anything like the establishment in which you are now studying. Originally university just referred to a group of men that have got together like a guild. And in fact the term that will be more accurately used of medieval universities would be a studio in general, is a 13th century term, which means a craft guild of learning a place where people do study in general. Universities started off with quite free and easy systems. And the 12th century they had a lot of flexibility. We're going to come back to that when we think about student life. Gradually over the 13th century and the 14th century and so on, they became more and more regularised. Kings and bishops started to see that sponsoring a university might be quite a good thing. It might do a lot for their reputation. It might also give them a great deal of influence. Really in 1200 though, there's only a few institutions that could even really aspire to this fancy title, Studio of General Eil, maybe Bologna, Paris, Oxford, maybe Soleno. But there was quite a lot of schools, like those cathedral schools and urban schools I was talking about before, which were on the way to becoming general establishments of learning, but weren't there yet. Some, Studio of General Eil, also specialised in different disciplines, so Montpellier, for example, became very famous for its medical tuition. I've named a couple of universities and I've put up on the overhead a list of some of the early universities to be established. The first two I've already mentioned Bologna and Paris. So the two dates that we've got there, 1088 and 1150 are very approximate. As I say, the starting of a university in these early days was a very free and easy system. It was really a group of students and a group of teachers broadly in the same place. Now, also in the 12th century and early 13th century, you get the foundation of Oxford and Cambridge, but you will notice that the remaining UK universities are very far down this list. We are well into the 15th century before we get the foundation of places like St Andrews and Glasgow and into the 16th century for many of the other universities that we think of now as ancient universities. How these universities came about, the structures that they used have been studied by another scholar called Alan Coburn, a very interesting book called The Medieval University. And he suggested that the way that universities emerged followed a variety of different archetypes. Now, I want to draw out two of them that relate to Bologna in South Europe and Paris in North Europe. Now Bologna was dominated by students. Students were really calling the shots in Bologna. They tended to be an older group of folk and they tended to be trying to get some kind of professional qualification and something like law or medicine to allow them to have a good career. And when they moved to the near the masters that were teaching in the area, they wanted affordable lodgings, good food and so on and they wanted a good education. Now, because a university didn't have any set buildings or any set placed to be, they had a lot of bargaining power. And they got together and did bargain to get good rates with the townspeople and also good rules that they were happy with with the masters. So they were able to enforce certain rules about how far a master could travel without permission, for example. In response, the masters themselves formed a guild and started requiring things like a certain level of attainment from their students. But the way that Bologna emerged was very student dominated and the idea of a rector, you will know that our university too has a rector as somebody who represents the students and is the head of senate, comes out of this sort of a model. Now, Paris in the North, the trend is really quite the other way around. The power lies with the masters, the teachers of this ad hoc community. Students going to Paris tended to be a little younger and less mature, perhaps as young as 14. And they didn't have the same clear life goals necessarily. So it was quite easy for masters to be in a dominant position over their younger students, who tended to be preparing, for example, for a life in the church. So masters were able to determine things like what students were allowed to wear, what their curriculum would involve, and so on. There were other models as well, and Alan Cobbins' book talks about these. You might want to explore them in a bit more detail. By the 14th and 15th century, these models have consolidated into a university more like you would recognise today. And of course, by then, masters were paid an academic salary, so there was no more possibility for students to control what they couldn't learn. Because in the early days, masters depended on money coming from their students directly in fees. So that's my framework of how universities emerged. What I'd like to turn to now is how student life was in these early universities. So what was life like as a medieval student? Well, some of the differences have already become apparent. You didn't have a set building that you studied in. You travelled to listen to the ideas and thinking of different masters. Students could travel all over Europe. Many students did. John of Soulsbray, for example, might as well be a student for many, many years, travelling to different parts of Europe. Students would go into university much younger than you guys, about 14, 15 years old. So what their foundational knowledge would be much lower than we would expect here at university today. Books were really expensive. There was no grand library for students to go and do research. And they were very dependent on what they were taught by their master. Students were very unlikely to own books and masters probably only owned a few books. So communication did depend on an oral interaction. All the teaching was in Latin and that meant that students could confidently travel all over Europe to hear the best lectures. It also meant, of course, that education was an elite activity. It required you not only to have money and to have the free time to be travelling, but also to have the language skills to allow you to do that. Of course, it was also a very male-dominated environment. In fact, quite a misogynistic environment, probably, of wine, women and song. And certainly these young and potentially hot-headed scholars got themselves into trouble more than once. We have quite a lot of records of fights breaking out between students and people living in the town. They're called town and gown riots. This famous one is the Saint Scholastica Day riot in Oxford in 1355, when 63 scholars and 30 locals died in a very large bout of Fisty Cups. Another thing that was very expensive was candles. So classes would start with the light. I don't know how much it appeals to you to think that you might have to start class at 5am. I'm certainly glad that I don't have to start lecturing at that time. Now, I said I was going to come back to how we know that student life was like that. Because we have sources, but they are not the level of records that we have today. Universities did not even have records in the same way, because they were not organised, co-heared, institutions, certainly not in their very early years. So what sorts of things do we have? Well, we have a variety of different sources that we can use to piece things together. One of the things that we have is early legal documents about the university. So particularly notable example of this is the statutes for Paris University, which were issued by PayPal Commission in 1215. And these are a set of rules that set out all sorts of things about university life. What you'll notice about them is that it's much more about the pragmatics of life than the modern university documents, which probably has all sorts of good intentions, goals, but they'll be really quite abstract. These statutes reflect a very small community in which scholars and masters really knew each other well. So for example, in these statutes, if one of the students died, half of the masters in the university would go to their funeral. And if a master died, everybody would go. Of course, this seems a little strange to us, but if you bear in mind for Saint Scholastica Day, right, Saint Tyre was mentioning earlier, you might realise that the risk of dying in the medieval of period was somewhat higher than it is today. The statutes also set out things like what texts would be studied, which texts of Aristotle, for example, could and could not be studied, very controversial. They set out rules about who could be a master. They said that nobody was allowed to be a lecturer before they were 20 years old, and they must have studied for six years by then. Of course, nowadays, becoming a lecturer by 20 years old is not very realistic. However, if you were lecturing in theology, you would need to have studied for eight years and be at least 35 years old, which tells us something, of course, about which disciplines they prioritised. We also have some slightly more fun documents. We have accounts of student life written by scholars that were there at the time. For example, Jacques De Vietri, who went on to be a cardinal and a bishop in France, wrote about his time at the University of Paris, and said with an amusing degree of consternation that students wrangled and disputed, not merely about the various sects or some discussion, but the differences between countries also caused dissension, hatred and animosity. So it seems that this culture of Fistikus is even recorded in the writings of quite illustrious figures who had studied. We also have some student songs. The best known one is usually called Gaudi-Amazighi-Tur, and it's sung quite commonly at lots of university graduations. You might sing it at your graduation. It's real title isn't Gaudi-Amazighi-Tur, that's the first two words of the song. It's really called on the briefness of life. This is a song which sings very enthusiastically about the teachers and the university life, and that we should long live the academy in recommending study. However, it also talks about pretty maiden to our easy and beautiful on the eye and how much fun it is to spend time with them. Finally, we also have pictures of student life illustrations in various texts. I've put one of them up on the overhead, and you can see that we have a set up very much like the set up here today. The person at the podium certainly isn't a woman, but the students, as you can see, are sitting taking notes and listening to a lecture. As you can also see, there are some of them taking notes like I can see some of you are taking notes and some of them not really paying attention, which is not unfamiliar to me as a lecturer either. Those are the sorts of sources. There's a historian I use to help me understand what student life was like and what university was like in those early days of the Foundings of Establishments like Bologna and Paris. I said I wanted to talk to you a little bit more about the University of Paris, because the University of Paris is a fascinating institution. If not an archetype of what a university was like, certainly one of the most interesting and one of the ones we know the most about. Now in the 12th century, Paris became the place to go to learn. It had everything you could possibly want and it attracted lots and lots of masters and students. It did this because of a variety of factors. One of them was that there were already lots of schools in Paris. You remember I spoke, as I said, about the establishment of Cathedral schools and urban schools. Paris had them popping up all over the place. There were lots and lots of schools in the vicinity of Paris. Paris itself had the undergone rapid growth recently. Paris also had an atmosphere which allowed quite free and easy access between masters and students. Now this was like a snowball. The more students went to Paris, the more masters felt that Paris was the place to teach. But of course, if all the best masters were in Paris, then Paris was going to attract the students to study there. Also, Paris offered good food and wine as we might expect of France. It had good lodgings and of course, if all your friends from home were going to study in Paris, that would make it an even more attractive place to go. By the 1140s, Paris has masters on all manner of subjects. And probably the most famous of those masters was a Scullicor Peter Abelard. If you want to understand medieval learning, you really must go and find out more about Peter Abelard. He is a fascinating character. He wrote extensively and potentially heretically, certainly, the church perceived it to be heretically on all sorts of aspects of philosophy. He also wrote a biography of his own life which is both a fascinating and enjoyable read. When Abelard had a very high opinion of his own abilities, perhaps rightly, but when Abelard wanted to show what a great Sculler he was, it was to Paris that he went. And of course, not only the ones, but several times because he not only was a great Sculler and thinker, but also had a great art for not making friends and certainly upset some of the other masters that were in Paris. So, receiving what university life was like in terms of lying woman and song, in terms of where you might go, you'd want to go to Paris, but once you went there, what did you do? Did you get to study history and geology and physics and all the disciplines of the modern university? Well, no, no, you didn't. Very few of the modern disciplines existed. This is where we look back to that classical inheritance that I started the lecture with. The curriculum in the medieval university came out of the classical curriculum. When the student went to university, they had to complete at least two levels of study, potentially three level of studies if they wanted to do a professional qualification. The first thing that they studied was three subjects called the Trivium, Trivium 3. They were grammar, logic and rhetoric. These are basically the skills of how to learn. Grammar is about language skills and the mechanics of writing, how to express yourself. Logic is about reasoning and thinking through problems. And rhetoric or dialectic or debate, any of these words, is about engaging with other people to try and persuade them to your viewpoint using a reasoned argument and defending your own argument. Now these skills continue to underpin our curriculum today and our expectations of students today, but we don't teach them as specific subjects anymore. Once a student had done those three subjects, they could then move on to the Trivium. The Trivium was the conceptual framework of knowledge. It was some of the details of what was considered to be knowledge. And the four subjects, the four subjects in the Trivium were arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music. Students may also study history. Every single student had to do those subjects. Every single student had to study this broad arts degree. That was considered initially to be very necessary preparation for your ultimate goal, which was supposed to be the study of theology. Now, it wasn't always a study of theology. By the 13th century, there were professional university qualifications also in law and medicine. Many students we know from sources were increasingly reluctant on the arts degree front because they were seeking together qualification, which would allow them then to go into these professions. However, that was the broad curriculum. Something that was very important that came into the curriculum in the 12th century was the ideas of Aristotle. Now, at the very start, the lecture I talked about played to an Aristotle having different ideas about what really existed. Aristotle argued that what existed was what we could experience with our general senses. The study of this new logic began in the 12th century. Aristotle had been lost to West. It had been preserved in Islamic knowledge, Islamic books, but it hadn't been preserved in Western Europe. This was a new field of study and it had quite a lot of influence on the curriculum. It was also very controversial. So that's what they studied. How did students learn? Did they do what you guys do? Did they go to some lectures? Maybe go to some seminars? Maybe go and study in the library? Did they have to write essays? Well, not really. No. There certainly were still lectures, but studying in the medieval university was about studying one text. Where I would expect you to go away and read half a dozen books or more on the subject. In the medieval period there were a few very authoritative texts. The Bible, of course, was the most important one. And to read, as the word was used in the medieval university to lectio, was to gloss a text, to explain line by line what that text meant. Now, there were a few authoritative texts, not just the Bible. And these texts could internally or with other texts present statements which disagreed with each other, which contradicted each other. Now, since these books were considered entirely authoritative, entirely correct, one of the things that medieval learning involved was finding ways to use logic to reconcile these apparently different or contradictory positions. And list of these would be provided questatio. Our statements that seem to disagree with each other and students would be set the task of trying to find ways to logically reconcile the ideas. Some of these questatio were put into huge volumes like Thomas Aquinas' Sumafiologica, which was a very influential text. There were also disputatio disputes or qualabets. Qualabets were big university occasions where two great scholars would debate a topic. There is a modern legacy of this in the viber that you have to do at the end of your PhD if you study to that level. But what you'll notice from all these teaching methods is that they are not about going to the library and doing research. They are about looking at a few authoritative sources and using reason and logic to debate and harmonise them. And there's a special word for the scholars who did this. The word scholastic might come up in your reading. Scholastic was a schoolman who used this method of philosophical debate, which sought in particular to bring together Christian ideas, Christian doctrines, and classical ideas from the pre-Christian scholars like Plato and Aristotle. And when you are reading upon this topic, this will be something that comes up a lot. It's a very complicated topic. But if you can at least identify some of the key threads in your reading that will be probably sufficient. So we started at the modern university. I said the modern university is a research institution. It's an institution with rules and regulations, with permanent buildings, with chairs that you can sit on with are reasonably comfortable. And cafe facilities for you to go and get your lunch after this lecture. They are places with big libraries with lots and lots of books. And places where assessment is done through written work. Now what we've seen here is that that is not where they came from. The medieval university, the origins of our modern university, was much more ad hoc. It didn't have the same institutional structures that we do today, although it developed them. It also was not driven by how many papers you could publish, for example. It wasn't assessed by written coursework. It was very much an oral institution, in which learning was done through debate and reasoning. A few key things that I want to leave you with, then a few key final thoughts. The development of institutions of learning was driven by demand and need. It was not something that emerged because people had some idealistic desire to learn. There was a need for education. And the circumstances in the 12th century were also ripe for intellectual explosion. And so the late medieval period, kind of the 12th or the 15th century, we see lots and lots of universities popping up, largely in towns, are all over Western Europe. We've seen that in these institutions, individual teachers had a great deal of personal authority, and the charisma of an individual teacher would have a really big effect on whether they were successful, whether they attracted students, whether they got paid. The medieval university had a far smaller number of texts, but these texts held a lot more authority, and were questioned only with an intention of reconciling any differences in views that they expressed rather than to question their content as such. And so the classical dialectic method of learning was the predominant form of teaching and learning in the medieval university. It is not difficult to see how that slowly over a few hundred years has led to modern research methods, has led to our questioning of our sources, our exploration of meaning. The medieval university is the origin of the modern university, it was very different, but you can see how what we have today, what you've been listening to today has emerged out of a medieval past. Thank you very much for listening today. I hope you all enjoy the seminar, which will be on Wednesday about this subject, and you are free to go and get your lunch.

ielts-listening-0240-cam5-test-4-part-4.wav,"Okay, are you all settled? Well, first of all, welcome to Cardiff University. I'm here to explain what we can offer you. Now, as a new student at the university, you will probably need some sort of guidance to help you to use the library effectively, to study and research. Some of you have asked about a guided tour, but we find this rather muddles people. So, in this first week, we ran a series of talks which focus on different aspects of the library and its resources. You'll also find that to get the most out of the library, you really do need to be computer literate. And so, all this term, we run small classes, which will bring you up to speed on how to access the computer-loaded information. Okay, now let me give you an outline of what's available to you. You'll find that the computers are increasingly used as a research tool. Many students do most of their research on the internet, and the library computers are permanently online. Having found what you need, you'll find you can readily save text on your personal computer space to print off when you need. You might think that it is the fastest way to get information, but the links can be slow. Clearly, you can find lots on there, but much of it is useless information, as it is from highly debatable sources. So, be critical. You'll also find that the library has loaded several CD-ROMs onto the computers from specialist reference sources, such as the MLA. It means we can expand what we offer you at very little extra cost, and saves us having to invest in more and more books. The CD-ROMs contain exactly the same information as the reference books, as the two are updated together. Now, most of you will need to refer to journal articles in your work, and you'll find you can also access these online, and we encourage you to do so. Clearly, some of you will find the printed version more accessible as it sits on the shelves, but I'm afraid the intention is to phase these out eventually. However, you will still be able to print off a version of the text, rather than photocopying the journal pages. So, you must get used to working online. Naturally, we do still have the full range of classic reference books, additional to the CD-ROMs for you to use, and there are several copies of each one. This is because some of you may prefer to borrow a book rather than sit in the library. There is a restricted loan time on these, so that they are not missing from the shelves for too long. Although there is a section manager for each part of the library, they are very busy, and so, if you do get stuck looking for things, you should ask the relevant cataloging assistant. As your training supervisor, I just oversee your induction, and will not be around after this initial week. Some of you may be interested to know that the library is offering specialised training sessions on writing a dissertation. Obviously, this is not relevant to those of you who are undergraduates. It is just for post-graduates. Your department will discuss the planning stage of the dissertation, i.e. what you're going to do with you, and we will focus on the structure of it. However, the training will also include some time on the computers. I realise most of you know how to organise files, but we can show you the different ways to run data programmes. Your tutors will tell you at the outset how to set out the chapters they require, but you will need to ask them how they would like you to organise the bibliography, because it varies depending on your subject area. When you've got something together, the trainer here will look through the draft version for you to see if it's okay. And one final point. For those of you who have registered from abroad, we can offer individual sessions on dissertations if you feel you need them. If you require language lessons, then they are available from the International Centre next to the Law Department.",239.064125,177.1909524275129,Fast
short-stories-0289-292-colonial-williamsburg.wav,"Colonial Williamsburg. Travelers in the desert or the jungle sometimes see the remains of old cities. These cities were once large and prosperous, but something has changed. Perhaps the climate got drier or wetter. Perhaps the trade routes, which had brought merchants to the city, now went elsewhere. Perhaps enemies destroyed them. Or perhaps disease or famine drove the people away. Other cities, which were once important, have become less so in time. Jamestown, Virginia, the first English colony in America, is now only in historic sight. It began as the capital of Virginia, but when fire destroyed the government buildings in 1699, the capital was moved to nearby Williamsburg. Williamsburg was an important town for many years. The British governors lived there, and two of them worked on the plans for the town and its buildings. The College of William and Mary was established there in the 1690s. The second oldest college in America. As the capital, Williamsburg contained many public buildings, including a courthouse, a jail, a powder magazine, the governor's palace, and the government building. Of course, there were many private houses as well. From 1699 until 1780, Williamsburg was the capital of Virginia. Many people came there for government and legal business. It was also a social center with dances, fairs, horse races, and auctions. The governor and his wife provided expensive dinners and entertainment for their guests. Most of the important people in Virginia owned tobacco plantations. In 1612, John Rolf had first raised tobacco to sell to England. Soon tobacco farming was Virginia's most important business. Most planters were able to build large houses and buy slaves to do their work. One plantation owner is said to have owned 300,000 acres of land and 1,000 black slaves, as well as having large amounts of money. The planters were the leaders of this colonial society, and they resented British interference in their local government. When England imposed taxes on the American colonists in 1765, it was a Virginian, Patrick Henry, who spoke against them. His words, give me liberty or give me death, help to inspire the American Revolution. As complaints about British rule increased, it was Virginians who led the rebels. George Washington became commander of the Revolutionary Army, and Thomas Jefferson drafted the Declaration of Independence in 1776. In 1780, the capital of Virginia was moved to Richmond. Williamsburg was now simply a small college town of local importance. Not much changed in Williamsburg for many years. In the 20th century, the Reverend Dr. Goodwin, who was the priest at the Williamsburg church, had the idea of restoring Williamsburg to the way it appeared in colonial days. Goodwin approached John D. Rockefeller Jr. with his idea, and Rockefeller agreed to finance this project. Building in 1926, the old buildings of Williamsburg were restored to their original form. First were the college buildings, then the Rally Tavern, the government building, the governor's palace, and so on. Buildings that had been destroyed over time were reconstructed from plans and descriptions. Soon the restored buildings were open to the public. Guides dressed in 18th century costumes show visitors through the buildings and gardens. Visitors can also travel to nearby tobacco plantations. Now, tourists who pay admission to visit this wonderful historic town finance much of the work of restoration and conservation.",237.400875,140.26907019613975,Ideal
short-stories-0169-170-william-shakespeare.wav,"William Shakespeare. There has been many great writers in the history of English literature, but there is no doubt about which writer was the greatest. Many people consider William Shakespeare to have been the best writer who ever lived. William Shakespeare was born in the town of Stratford, England in the year 1564. When he was a young man, Shakespeare moved to the city of London, where he began writing plays. His plays were soon very successful, and were enjoyed both by common people of London and also by the rich and famous. In addition to his plays, Shakespeare wrote many short poems and a few long poems. Like his plays, these poems are still famous today. Shakespeare's most famous plays include Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, Hamlet, Kinglier, Athello, and Julius Caesar. Usually Shakespeare did not invent the stories that he told in his plays. Instead, he wrote his plays using stories that already existed. However, Shakespeare's plays told these stories in a more interesting way than ever before. Some of the stories were tragedies, some were comedies, some described historical events. In his plays, Shakespeare revealed a very wide knowledge of many areas of life. The characters in his plays discuss many different topics, often with the knowledge of experts. But what is even more impressive about these plays is Shakespeare's use of the English language. His vocabulary was very large, and Shakespeare seemed to have introduced many words to the language. Also, many of the phrases that are said by Shakespeare's characters are now used in everyday conversation. Today, writers often use quotations from Shakespeare's plays in their own works. But perhaps even the most impressive features of Shakespeare's plays are the characters within them. The many characters in his plays seem very different from each other, but they seem very realistic. The emotions they feel, the words they say, and the actions they perform are all easily understood. Many people who watch one of Shakespeare's plays will find that they know people who remind them somewhat of the characters in those plays. Shakespeare died in the year 1619, but his writings are still popular today. 400 years after they were written, the poems and plays were greatly admired by experts in literature, but also by people in general. Each year hundreds of thousands of people enjoy attending performances of Shakespeare's plays. No other writer in the English language has remained so popular for such a long time.",182.047375,135.12966061718825,Ideal

ielts-listening-0156-cam10-test-3-part-4.wav,"Today, I want to talk about Self-Regulatory Focus Theory and how the actions of leaders can affect the way followers approach different situations. Self-Regulatory Focus Theory is a theory developed by Tory Higgins. He says that a person's focus at any given time is to either approach pleasure or avoid pain. These are two basic motivations that each and every one of us has, and they cause us to have different kinds of goals. Promotion goals in different life situations emphasize achievement. Prevention goals are oriented towards the avoidance of punishment. In a specific situation, our thoughts might focus more on promotion goals or more on prevention goals. The theory suggests that two factors affect which goals we are focusing on. First, there is a chronic factor. This factor is connected to a person's personality and says that each person has a basic tendency to either focus more on promotion goals or focus more on prevention goals as part of his or her personality. Second, there is a situational factor which means that the context we are in can make us more likely to focus on one set of goals or the other. For example, we are more likely to be thinking about pleasure and to have promotion goals when we are spending time with a friend. In contrast, if we are working on an important project for our boss, we are more likely to try to avoid making mistakes and therefore have more prevention goals in our mind. Each has shown that the goals we are focusing on at a given time affect the way we think. For example, when focusing on promotion goals, people consider their ideal self, their aspirations and gains. They don't think about what they can lose, so they think in a happier mode, they feel more inspired to change. When people are focusing on prevention goals, they think about their ought self. What are they supposed to be? What are people expecting from them? They consider their obligations to others. As a result, they experience more anxiety and try to avoid situations where they could lose. Now that I have talked about the two focuses and how they affect people, I want to look at the idea that the way leaders behave or their style of leading can affect the focus that followers adopt in a specific situation. In talking about leadership, we often mention transformational leaders and transactional leaders. Transformational leaders, when interacting with their followers, focus on their development. In their words and actions, transformational leaders highlight change. Their speech is passionate and conveys a definitive vision. All of these things can encourage followers to think about what could be. In other words, they inspire a promotion focus in their followers. In contrast, transactional leaders focus on developing clear structures that tell their followers exactly what is expected of them. While they do explain the rewards people will get for following orders, they emphasize more how a follower will be punished or that a follower won't get rewarded if his or her behavior doesn't change. In short, they emphasize the consequences of making a mistake. This emphasis will clearly lead followers to focus on avoiding punishment and problems. This is clearly a prevention focus. In conclusion, it is important to understand that one focus is not necessarily better than the other one. For a designer who works in a field where a lot of innovation is needed, a promotion focus is probably better. In contrast, a prevention focus which causes people to work more cautiously and produce higher quality work might be very appropriate for a job like a surgeon, for example. The main point of the research though is that the actions of leaders can greatly influence whether people approach a situation with more of a promotion focus or more of a prevention focus.",343.408875,112.34421358504493,Ideal
ielts-listening-0116-cam12-test-1-part-4.wav,"In public discussion of business, we take certain values for granted. Today, I'm going to talk about four of them. Collaboration, hard work, creativity and excellence. Most people would say they're all good things. I'm going to suggest that's an over-simple view. The trouble with these values is that their theoretical concepts removed from the reality of day-to-day business. Pursue values, by all means, but be prepared for what may happen as a result. They can actually cause damage, which is not at all the intention. Business leaders generally try to do the right thing, but all too often the right thing backfires. If those leaders adopt values without understanding and managing the side effects that arise, the values can easily get in the way of what's actually intended. Okay, so the first value I'm going to discuss is collaboration. Let me give you an example. On a management training course I once attended, we were put into groups and had to construct a bridge across a stream, using building blocks that we were given. The rule was that everyone in the team had to move at least one building block during the construction. This was intended to encourage teamwork. But it was really a job best done by one person. The other teams tried to collaborate on building the structure and descended into confusion, with everyone getting in each other's way. Our team leader solved the challenge brilliantly. She simply asked everyone in the team to move a piece of few centimeters to comply with the rule, and then let the person in the team with an attitude for puzzles like this build it alone. We finished before any other team. My point is that the task wasn't really suited to team working. So why make it one? Teamwork can also lead to inconsistency, a common cause of poor sales. In the case of a smart phone that a certain company launched, one director wanted to target the business market, and another demanded it was aimed at consumers. The company wanted both directors to be involved, so gave the product a consumer friendly name, but marketed it to companies. The result was that it met the needs of Niser Group. It would have been better to let one director or the other have his way, not both. Now, industriousness or hard work. It's easy to mock people who say they work hard. After all, a hamster running around in a wheel is working hard, and getting nowhere. Of course, hard work is valuable, but only when properly targeted, otherwise it wastes the resources that companies value most, time and energy, and that's bad for the organisation. There's a management model that groups people according to four criteria. Clever, hard working, stupid, and lazy. Here, lazy means having a rational determination not to carry out unnecessary tasks. It doesn't mean trying to avoid work altogether. Most people display two of these characteristics, and the most valuable people are those who are both clever and lazy. They possess intellectual clarity, and they don't rush into making decisions. They come up with solutions to save the time and energy spent by the stupid and hard working group. Instead of throwing more man-hours at a problem, the clever and lazy group looks for a more effective solution. Next, we come to creativity. This often works well creating an attention-grabbing TV commercial, for example, which might lead to increased sales. But it isn't always a good thing. Some advertising campaigns are remembered for their creativity without having any effect on sales. This happened a few years ago with the launch of a chocolate bar. Subsequent research showed that plenty of consumers remembered the adverts, but had no idea what was being advertised. The trouble is that the creator derives pleasure from coming up with the idea, and wrongly assumes the audience for the campaign will share that feeling. A company that brings out thousands of new products may seem more creative than a company that only has a few, but it may be too creative and make smaller profits. Creativity needs to be targeted to solve a problem that the company has identified, just coming up with more and more novel products isn't necessarily a good thing. And finally, excellence. We all know companies that claim they strive for excellence, but it takes a long time to achieve excellence. In business, being first with a product is more profitable than having the best product. A major study of company performance compared pioneers, that is companies bringing out the first version of a particular product, with followers, the companies that copied and improved on that product. The study found that the pioneers commanded an average market share of 29%. While the followers achieved less than half that, only 13%. Even though their product might have been better. Insisting on excellence in everything we do is time consuming, wastes energy, and leads to losing out on opportunities. Sometimes second-rate work is more worthwhile than excellence. Make sure it's excellent, sounds like a good approach to business, but the just-get-started approach is likely to be more successful.",395.808875,130.36594998027775,Ideal

ielts-listening-0194-cam7-test-1-part-2.wav,"Thank you all for coming to my talk this evening. It's nice to see so many people in the audience. For those of you who don't know very much about PS Camping, let me start by giving you some background information about the company. The company started 25 years ago. It actually opened as a retail chain selling camping equipment. And then 20 years ago it bought a small number of campsites in the UK and began offering camping holidays. The company grew rapidly and has been providing holidays in continental Europe for the last 15 years. If you book a camping holiday with us you'll have a choice of over 300 sites. In Italy we now have some 64 sites that we either own or have exclusive use of. France is where we have the majority of sites and we currently have a project to expand into Switzerland. We also have a number of sites in northern Spain, particularly in the mountainous region of Pico-Stereo-Pah. We've upgraded all these Spanish sites and improved them considerably from their original three-star rating. We believe our holidays offer superb facilities for the whole family. Parents who want their children to be fully occupied for all or part of the day can take advantage of our children's activities. These are organised by our well-qualified and enthusiastic staff. Each day kicks off with a sports match, perhaps football or volleyball, followed by an hour of drama for everyone. This may include singing or dancing, mime or other activities. In the afternoon there's a different art activity for each day of the week, including a poster competition or model-making. What's more, our sites are truly child-friendly and with this in mind we operate a no-noise rule in the evenings. Children's evening activities usually finish at 9.30 or occasionally 10 and from 10.30 holiday makers are expected to be quiet in the areas where there are tents. We want nothing to go wrong on a PS-camping holiday, but if it does we also want all our customers to be insured. If you haven't organised an annual insurance policy of your own, you'll need to take out the low-cost cover we offer and we require that you arrange this when you make your holiday reservation. There are many advantages to choosing PS-camping and to recommending it to others. As a regular customer you'll be kept informed of special offers and your friends can benefit from 10% off their holiday or book a luxury tent for the price of a standard one. In return we'll send you a thank you present which you can choose from a list of high-quality items. When it comes to our tents these are equipped to the highest standard. We really do think of every essential detail from an oven and cooking rings fueled by bottled gas to mirrors in the bedroom areas. If you don't want to cook indoors you can borrow a barbecue if you ask in advance for one to be made available and there's even a picnic blanket to sit on outside your tent. Inside a box of games and toys can be found and children's tents can be hired if required. All tents have a fridge and if you want to spend the day on the beach for example ask for a specially designed PS-camping call box which will keep your food and drinks chilled. There are excellent washing facilities at all our sites with washing machines and clothes lines in the central areas along with mobs and buckets in case your tent needs cleaning during a stay. All sites have a cafe and or a shop for those who'd rather eat in than dine at a local restaurant.",254.4901875,146.41036012439577,Ideal
short-stories-0251-254-potato-chips-and-corn-chips.wav,"Potato chips and corn chips. The story goes that the potato chip was invented in Saratoga Springs, New York in 1853. Multimillionaire Cornelius Vanderbilt complained to the chef that his fried potatoes were sliced too thickly. Chef George Krump responded by slicing the potatoes paper thin and frying them in hot oil. The potato chip became an instant success. Many companies have made large profits on chips. The most successful brands are associated with the Friedo-Lay Company. Herman W. Lay of Nashville, Tennessee was selling potato chips from the back of his car in the early 1930s. He soon became a successful distributor for a brand of potato chips which were made in Atlanta, Georgia. When that company ran into financial problems, Lay arranged to buy them out. It now became H.W. Lay and Company. Meanwhile in Texas, Almer Dullin was trying to sell chips made from corn dough. This was an old Mexican recipe which Dullin had found in San Antonio, Texas. At first, these Friedo's corn chips were made in Mr. Dullin's mother's kitchen. It took a few years before they sold very well. Mr. Dullin moved the company to Dallas and began to expand his market. In 1945, he granted the H.W. Lay Company the rights to make Friedo's corn chips for the American Southeast. In 1961, the two companies merged to become Friedo-Lay Inc. In 1965, Friedo-Lay merged with Pepsi to become Pepsi Co. Inc. One of the largest snack food and beverage companies in the world. In 2000, Friedo-Lay sold 58% of all the snack chips in the USA. In Canada and the United States, Friedo-Lay products had sales of $9.9 billion. The most popular brand was Lay's potato chips, followed by Doritos, Ruffles, Tostitos, Cheetos, and Free Toes. Internationally, Friedo-Lay has 28% of the market worldwide. That amounts to $5.9 billion annually. Why are potato chips in corn chips so popular? Well, they are versatile. You can eat them by themselves or with a sandwich for lunch. They can replace other forms of potatoes and corn. They can also come in various flavors. For example, potato chip flavors include ketchup, salt and vinegar, barbecue, deal pickle, and cheddar. Potato chips can be thick or thin, ridged or flat, spicy or bland. Chips can be made from many things besides potatoes. There is corn dough and tortilla dough, of course. But chips can also be made from sweet potatoes, parsnips, taro root, peppers, and other vegetables. One caution about potato chips is that they are not a good source of nutrition. Parents who send their children to school with a bag of potato chips for lunch need to remember that these are just a snack. Because snack chips usually contain a lot of fat, they can also lead to weight gain. It is better not to eat snack chips too often and not to eat them instead of healthier foods. In Canada, nearly $2 billion is spent on snack foods every year, and half of this is spent on chips. People are always looking for new flavors to try. Spicy chips are gaining in popularity. The snack chip industry just keeps on growing.",231.4449375,136.8792091207439,Ideal
short-stories-0150-151-easter.wav,"Easter. Traditionally, Easter has been one of the most important holidays of the Christian religion. For Christians, the Easter holiday celebrates the death of Jesus Christ, who died for the benefit of all people. The exact date when Easter is celebrated is different each year, but it is always held in early spring, during March or April. There are two very important days that make up the Easter holiday, which occurs during the spring season. The first of these days is called Good Friday. Christians recognize Good Friday as the day when Jesus suffered and died on behalf of humanity. The second of these days is called Easter Sunday. Easter Sunday occurs two days after Good Friday. Christians celebrate Easter Sunday as the day when Jesus rose from the dead and went to heaven. For Christians, Easter is the most solemn holiday of the year. Many people attend church services on Good Friday and on Easter Sunday. Easter is also a time for celebration. Some Easter traditions come from old springtime festivals that existed even before Christianity. One of the traditions associated with Easter is the painting of Easter eggs. People take chickens' eggs, make them hollow, and then paint them with beautiful colors. Some people paint very beautiful and complex designs on the Easter eggs. Another Easter tradition is the Easter Bunny. According to tradition, the Easter Bunny is a magical rabbit that visits the homes of children on the night before Easter Sunday. The Easter Bunny hides chocolate candies shaped like eggs throughout the child's house. On the morning of Easter Sunday, the children must search throughout the house to find these many hidden treats.

ielts-listening-0146-cam10-test-1-part-2.wav,"On behalf of LP clubs, I'd like to welcome you all here today. My name's Sandy Fisher and I'm one of the fitness managers here. Before we start our tour of the club, I'll just run through some basic information about the facilities we have here, including recent improvements and explain the types of membership available. Our greatest asset is probably our swimming pool, which at 25 metres isn't a limbic sized, but now we've expanded it to 8 lanes, it's much wider. This means there are rarely more than a couple of people at a time in each lane. Unfortunately, there isn't space for an outdoor pool here, but the glass roof on the swimming pool is partly retractable, which means you can enjoy something of the open air experience on warmer days. Our recently refurbished fitness suite has all the latest exercise equipment, including 10 new running machines and a wide range of weight training machines. Each member is given full training in how to operate the equipment, and there is always a trainer on duty to offer help and advice. So we do have adult only times after six, and at certain times at weekends, children are well catered for. Older children continue to benefit from a wide range of tuition, anything from trampolining to yoga. One thing all our members appreciate about us is that we take very good care of them. This starts on day one with your personal assessment. You're asked to fill in a questionnaire giving details of any health problems. One of our personal trainers will then go through this with you. The trainer will then take you through the safety rules for using the equipment in the fitness suite. During your next exercise session, a personal trainer will work with you to make sure you understand these. It's very important to do this because we really do want to avoid having any sports injuries. There's a lot more to looking after yourself than simply lifting weights. At the end of the personal assessment, the trainer will draw up a plan, outlining what you should try to achieve within a six week period. This will then be reviewed at the end of the six weeks. Now, I'll just quickly run through the types of membership we have available. All members must pay a joining fee of £90 in addition to the rates for the monthly membership fees. Gold membership entitles you to free entry at all LP clubs. There are now LP clubs in all major cities and towns, so if you travel a lot, this will be a great advantage. Individual gold membership costs £50 a month, and joint membership for you and your partner will cost £75. Premier membership is for professional people whose work commitments make it difficult for them to use the club during the day, and so LP gives booking preferences to Premier members at peak times. This means you'll find it easier to book the sessions at times that suit you. Reciprocal arrangements with other LP clubs are available to Premier members. Premier membership is for individuals only, but you'll be sent passes for guests every month. The monthly fee is £65. You don't have to have any special clothes or equipment when you visit the club. We provide ropes and hair dryers in the changing rooms, but it's very important to remember your photo card because you won't be able to get in without it.

ielts-listening-0080-cam15-test-4-part-4.wav,"Hi, everyone. In this session, I'll be presenting my research about the social history of Britain during the Industrial Revolution. I particularly looked at how ordinary lives were affected by changes that happened at that time. This was a time that saw the beginning of a new phenomenon, consumerism, where buying and selling goods became a major part of ordinary people's lives. In fact, it was in the 19th century that the quantity and quality of people's possessions was used as an indication of the wealth of the country. Before this, the vast majority of people had very few possessions, but all that was changed by the Industrial Revolution. This was the era from the mid-18th to the late 19th century, when improvements in how goods were made as well as in technology triggered massive social changes that transformed life for just about everybody in several key areas. First, let's look at manufacturing. When it comes to manufacturing, we tend to think of the Industrial Revolution in images of steam engines and coal, and it's true that the Industrial Revolution couldn't have taken place at all if it weren't for these new sources of power. They marked an important shift away from the traditional water mills and windmills that had dominated before this. The most advanced industry for much of the 19th century was textiles. This meant that fashionable fabrics and lace and ribbons were made available to everyone. Before the Industrial Revolution, most people made goods to sell in small workshops, often in their own homes. But enormous new machines were now being created that could produce the goods faster and on a larger scale, and these required a lot more space. So large factories were built, replacing the workshops and forcing workers to travel to work. In fact, large numbers of people migrated from villages into towns as a result, as well as manufacturing, there were new technologies in transport, contributing to the growth of consumerism. The horse-drawn stagecoaches and carts of the 18th century, which carried very few people and goods and travelled slowly along poorly-surface roads, were gradually replaced by the numerous canals that were constructed. These were particularly important for the transportation of goods. The canals gradually fell out of use, though, as railways were developed, becoming the main way of moving goods and people from one end of the country to the other. And the goods they moved weren't just coal, iron, clothes and so on. Significantly, they included newspapers, which meant that thousands of people were not only more knowledgeable about what was going on in the country, but could also read about what was available in the shops, and that encouraged them to buy more. So faster forms of transport resulted in distribution becoming far more efficient. Goods could now be sold all over the country instead of just in the local market. The third main area that saw changes that contributed to consumerism was retailing. The number and quality of shops grew rapidly, and in particular small shops suffered as customers flocked to the growing number of department stores, a form of retailing that was new in the 19th century. The entrepreneurs who opened these found new ways to stock them with goods and to attract customers. For instance, improved lighting inside greatly increased the visibility of the goods for sale. Another development that made goods more visible from outside resulted from the use of plate glass, which made it possible for windows to be much larger than previously. New ways of promoting goods were introduced too. Previously, the focus had been on informing potential customers about the availability of goods. Now there was an explosion in advertising trying to persuade people to go shopping. Flanders claims that one of the great effects of the industrial revolution was at a created choice. All sorts of things had had previously been luxuries from sugar to cutlery became conveniences, and before long they turned into necessities. Life without sugar or cutlery was unimaginable. Rather like mobile phones these days,",305.3125625,132.84746512846158,Ideal

ielts-listening-0050-cam16-test-1-part-2.wav,"Good morning everyone and welcome to Stevenson's one of the country's major manufacturers of metal goods. Thank you for choosing us for your two weeks of work experience. My name is Julia Simmons and since the beginning of this year I've been the managing director. Stevenson's is quite an old company. Like me the founder Ronald Stevenson went into the steel industry when he left school. That was in 1923. He set up this company when he finished his apprenticeship in 1926. Although he actually started making plans two years earlier in 1924 he was a very determined young man. Stevenson's long term plan was to manufacture components for the machine tools industry. Although in fact that never came about and for the automotive industry that is cars and lorries. However there was a delay of five years before that happened because shortly before the company went into production Stevenson was given the opportunity to make goods for hospitals and other players in the healthcare industry. So that's what we did for the first five years. Over the years we've expanded the premises considerably. We were lucky that the site is big enough so moving to a new location has never been necessary. However the layout is far from ideal for modern machinery and production methods. So we intend to carry out major refurbishment of this site over the next five years. I'd better give you some idea of what you'll be doing during your two weeks with us so you know what to expect. Most mornings you'll have a presentation from one of the managers to learn about their department, starting this morning with research and development. And you'll all spend some time in each department observing what's going on and talking to people. As long as you don't stop them from doing their work altogether. In the past a teacher from your school has come in at the end of each week to find out how the group were getting on. But your school isn't able to arrange that this year. Okay now I'll briefly help you to orientate yourselves around the site. As you can see we're in the reception area which we try to make attractive and welcoming to visitors. There's a corridor running left from here and if you go along that the door facing you at the end is the entrance to the coffee room. This looks out onto the main road on one side and some trees on the other and that'll be where you meet each morning. The factory is the very big room on the far side of the site. Next to it is the warehouse which can be accessed by lorries going up the road to the turning area at the end. You can get to the warehouse by crossing to the far side of the courtyard and then the door is on your right. Somewhere you'll be keen to find is the staff canteen. This is right next to reception. I can confidently say that the food's very good but the view isn't. The windows on one side look onto a corridor and courtyard which aren't very attractive at all and on the other onto the access road which isn't much better. You'll be using the meeting room quite often and you'll find it by walking along the corridor to the left of the courtyard and continuing along it to the end. The meeting room is the last one on the right and I'm afraid there's no natural daylight in the room. Then you'll need to know where some of the offices are. The Human Resources Department is at the front of this building so you head to the left along the corridor from reception and it's the second room you come to. It looks out onto the main road. And finally the board room where you'll be meeting sometimes. That has quite a pleasant view as it looks out onto the trees. Go along the corridor past the courtyard right to the end. The board room is on the left next to the factory. Okay now are there any questions before we move?",280.5123125,148.6565763490328,Ideal

When we sleep, our body retires itself and our brain processes everything we have learned during the day. Without enough sleep, we feel tired, lost focus and struggle to perform well in school or work. Doctors recommend that we should get 7 to 8 hours of sleep every night. But many people, especially students and workers sleep less because they stay up late watching TV using their phones or playing games. This can lead to serious problems like stress, memory loss and even health issues like high blood pressure and obesity. Good sleep helps improve memory, boost creativity and makes us feel energetic.
